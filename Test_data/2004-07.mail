Hi,

I got curious into the operating of ZeroConf, so I viewed the zeroconf.org
and multicastdns.org sites, read an article or two, noted the controversy
with LLMNR, and read draft-cheshire-dnsext-multicastdns-04.

This list seems pretty quiet (or the archive is broken...). That's too bad.
I'm just an innocent spectator, not really involved, who just want a "zero
configuration" network. I don't care if the solution is called ZeroConf,
mDNS, RendezVous, DNS-SD, LLMNR or whatever.

I understand that zeroconf involves 3 issues topics: automatic IP
allocation, name resolution and service discovery. (I don't understand the
last one, Automatic allocation of Multicast Addresses, yet).

The first, Link-local interface configuration seems more or less a done deal
with the 169.254/16 range and the draft-ietf-zeroconf-ipv4-linklocal-17.

The third, service discovery, seems focussed around DNS-SD, UPnP and SLP.
I'm probably ignore this (my time is unfortunately limited). My first
impression at least is that UPnP has unnecessary overhead, but I really
can't judge on DNS-SD and SLP.

The second, name resolution seems to focus on either LLMNR or mDNS. What is
the current status of mDNS? Should I conclude from the fact that
draft-cheshire-dnsext-multicastdns-04 is a individual submission (and can't
thus, according to IETF guidelines become a standards track RFC, but only
experimental or informational track), is not an IETF-endorsed activity, but
(probably just as important) a community-driven activity?

Two questions: is the above correct? In particular, are mDNS and LLMNR
compatible, and if not, does mDNS have functions LLMNR not have? Pointers
are welcome (I will read them both, but a short note or pointer is
appreciated).

Second, having just (partially) read draft-cheshire-dnsext-multicastdns-04,
is it useful to give feedback? I found an obvious type (FF0X::FB in section
25 should read FF02::FB), but I'm willing to give more feedback, if
appreciated. If so, were to sent it to? To this list, the authors
individually, or even rendezvous@lists.apple.com?

Kind regards,
Freek Dijkstra

PS: for the curious and interested: I work for the University of Amsterdam,
and have been to IETF 52&53 when I was a student, but have no professional
interest anymore. Just personal curiousity.

Freek,

The Zeroconf group and this list has been dedicated almost entirely to =
getting the IPv4 Link Local address assignment specification done and =
there has been little discussion for a long time of the other topics you =
mention - in general each of the specs you mention probably has it's own =
list (where you will probably see many of the same people).

Other earlier objectives of the zero-config group were dropped either =
because of lack of progress or because they were being covered =
elsewhere.

For comparison of mDNS vs LLMNR or of SLP vs DNS-SD vs UPnP you are best =
looking not just at the specs and the appropriate lists, but at who is =
promoting or actually using them and in what circumstances and trying to =
assess the reasons (both technical and commercial) for that choice.

Philip

The latest draft (17) of the specification has been accepted as a
proposed standard and has entered the RFC editor's queue.  The official
announcement will appear shortly.

I want to thank the numerous working group contributors, past and
present, who have both improved the document and engaged in a lively and
enlightening discussion about the nature and impact of local address
configuration.  I have learned a great deal and am extremely grateful to
have had the opportunity to coordinate this effort over the past five
years. 

I extend special appreciation to Stuart Cheshire.  His initial efforts
to establish this protocol proved decisive for our understanding and
design.  The document as it stands today remains largely intact from his
initial careful crafting.  He has assured that work on additional
caveats and context remain workable and consistent with the initial
vision.  His fastidious contributions are apparent throughout.  It has
been a pleasure and a privilege to work with Stuart through this
entire process. 

Regarding the matter of the intellectual property claim from Apple:
The patent expires this August.  I therefore suggest that this should
not present a concern to implementors of the standard.  I leave thorough
and legally cogent analysis of this statement to lawyers, however.  I
hope that you share my opinion that the "Dynamic Configuration of IPv4
Link-Local Addresses" is ready for general adoption as an IETF proposed
standard.  This seemed to be the prevalent opinion on the WG mailing
list when the matter was last discussed.

Pending any ongoing discussion of the intellectual property associated
with the specification over the next week, I will request that the
ZEROCONF WG be concluded.

Thanks again for all your hard work and congratulations for seeing this
important project through to completion.

All the best in your future endeavors!

Erik Guttman

Could someone tell me how long it would normaly take for that draft to
be accepted as a standard? Will the RFC be announced to that list?

The draft has been accepted as a standard already, by the IESG.

The document is now in the RFC editor's queue.  Please see
http://www.rfc-editor.org/queue.html - search for
draft-ietf-zeroconf-ipv4-linklocal-17.txt

From prior experience, I believe the RFC won't come out for at least 3-6
months.  There's a lot ahead of our doc in the queue.

Regards,

Erik
