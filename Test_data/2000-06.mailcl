The following is a long overdue wrap up of the thread last month:

  'zeroconf security - conclusions'

I will post a revised set of conclusions following this message.

I am omitting calls for either not supporting security or claiming
that it is out of scope, since security (configuration) *is* on the
WG charter.

Erik

---
1) Should we consider securing ARP to protect address configuration 
   against a 'hoarding attack'?  The DHC WG says no.

   ARP is not the only issue.

   DHCP servers would have to be able to distinguish between bogus
   and a legitimate requests for addresses.  This is not possible now.

2) Securing the network or securing the device?

Erik Guttman <erik.guttman@sun.com> proposed:

  http://www.merit.edu/mail.archives/zeroconf/msg00616.html

Thomas Narten <narten@raleigh.ibm.com> replied:

Agreement with Thomas from Peter Johansson <PJohansson@ACM.org> 
  http://www.merit.edu/mail.archives/zeroconf/msg00663.html
and Richard Johnson <raj@cisco.com>
  http://www.merit.edu/mail.archives/zeroconf/msg00664.html

Ross Finlayson <finlayson@live.com> added:

Thomas Marshall Eubanks <tme@21rst-century.com> was more pessimistic:

  http://www.merit.edu/mail.archives/zeroconf/msg00644.htm

Thomas Narten <narten@raleigh.ibm.com> suggested how this could be
implemented in an intuitive way, for consumers.
  http://www.merit.edu/mail.archives/zeroconf/msg00658.html

Donald E. Eastlake 3rd <lde008@dma.isg.mot.com> agreed with Thomas's
suggestion's being simple enough.
  http://www.merit.edu/mail.archives/zeroconf/msg00656.html

Peter Johansson <PJohansson@ACM.org> was concerned about the risk at 
the time of configuration, and suggested quaranting the network.
  http://www.merit.edu/mail.archives/zeroconf/msg00643.html

Steve Hanna <steve.hanna@sun.com> suggested instead a 'secure
network' especially for configuration, and other mechanisms.

3) ZEROCONF requirements will be silent to whether hosts implement
   security mechanisms for *non-zeroconf protocols* (DHC, DNS, SLP DAs,
   MADCAP, etc.)

4) Can we concentrate on the remote threats and allow social
   mechanisms to counter threats due to sharing a network with
   physically close neighbors?

   No.

Steve Hanna <steve.hanna@sun.com> 
   http://www.merit.edu/mail.archives/zeroconf/msg00625.html

5) Use of link level security or IPSec with a shared key to secure 
   zero configuration protocols?

Suggested by Steve Hanna <steve.hanna@sun.com> 
   http://www.merit.edu/mail.archives/zeroconf/msg00625.html

Bernard Aboba <aboba@internaut.com> replied that link-level security
requires all access points be secure.  He liked the idea of using 
IPsec to secure ZC protocols, but thought it may not be reasonable to
require that devices implement it.

6) What does "manual keying" implicitly require of a low-end 
   device's user interface capabilities?

7) Securing the LAN?  Is local encryption needed?

Thomas Narten <narten@raleigh.ibm.com> argues that it may be
unacceptable to have arbitrary traffic sent in the clear.  He
proposes that maybe ZEROCONF or another WG should look at the
problem of 'securing a LAN' (or set of LAN segments) where 
everyone on the 'inside' trusts each other and all traffic
will be encrypted and authenticated.  Key distribution
will be 'interesting' since we want it to be as minimal to
configure as possible.
  http://www.merit.edu/mail.archives/zeroconf/msg00661.html

Richard Johnson <raj@cisco.com> believes that link-layer 
mechanisms may provide enough security at L2.
  http://www.merit.edu/mail.archives/zeroconf/msg00665.html

Rose, William <Wrose@leviton.com> agrees with Richard Johnson
but adds that there are other considerations:  (1) traffic
analysis, (2) manual intervention - so that a device can only
join the network if it is physically 'set up' (at the minimum
a button pressed, etc.)

The following security requirement summary takes into consideration
the mailing list discussion and hopefully aligns it with the requirements
specification:

 0 Scope of discussion:

   0.1) The ZEROCONF WG is working on 4 protocol areas - host
        configuration, service discovery, name to address resolution
        and multicast address allocation.  Application level protocols
        (including device control) are out of scope.

        The goal is to not make IP any less secure, not to 'raise the
        bar.'

   0.2) The threats which have been discussed and broadly agreed upon
        are:

        . masquerading (A host uses zeroconf protocols to fool others
          by sending messages it shouldn't)
        . hoarding (A host subverts zeroconf protocols by pretending to
          have resources it doesn't have)
        . antagonistic server (This server undermines hosts because it
          uses a protocol which automatically configures hosts which
          use 'zeroconf protocols')

        Additional threats which were mentioned were:

        . Inventory attack - ZeroConf protocols (especially service 
          discovery) would allow thieves to take inventory very easily.
        . Evesdropping attack - Capturing ZC protocol messages issued by
          hosts use could inform about what the network is used for, how
          much it is used, etc.         
        . Denial of service attack - But is there anything specific to
          Zero Configuration networking here? 

 1 Conclusions of discussion:
    
   1.1)  Security for non-zeroconf protocols (DHCP, DNS, MADCAP) is out
         of scope.

   1.2)  Security for application level (device control) protocols is out 
         of scope.  

   1.3)  Security defaults 

         + Devices come without security configuration.
         + Devices operating in a network where security configuration
           is required discover this and can be configured.  To the 
           greatest extent possible, this configuration should not
           require manual intervention.

   1.4) It was suggested that the ability to authenticate messages as
        having come from a peer with a shared secret may not be enough.
        Encryption capability, to provide privacy, was suggested as
        being important.

 2 Requirements arising from discussion:

    2.1) Hosts MUST implement a security mechanism (or mechanisms) to 
         protect against the following threats:

          + Hoarding attack.

            . A host MUST be able to determine whether a multicast 
              address allocation claim (used in a claim and defend
              protocol) is legitimate or not, if configured to do so.

          + Masquerading attack.  

            . Service discovery, name to address resolution and 
              multicast address allocation services MUST support a 
              mechanism so that legitimate and illigitimate responses 
              can be differentiated, if configured to do so.

            . Note that in the case of name to address resolution, and
              multicast address allocation this can be used to prevent
              'hoarding attacks.'  A malevolent host could respond to 
              all names to prevent 'nameless' host from picking a
              unique name or claim all multicast group allocations.

          + Antagonistic server attack.  

            . A host MUST be able to determine if a server is posing
              as a 'service discovery registrar' or is legitimate.

              If a host implements DNSSec, DHC autentication, it 
              could use them to identify legitimate servers from
              antagonistic ones, but it is outside of the scope
              of the ZEROCONF WG to require or recommend its deployment.

    2.2) Hosts MAY implement security mechanisms to protect them against
         the following threats:

           + Evesdropping attack.  The host may be able to employ 
             layer 2 or layer 3 security to provide privacy for
             communications.  

    2.3) Hosts MUST be configurable to use that security, as easily
         as possible.
