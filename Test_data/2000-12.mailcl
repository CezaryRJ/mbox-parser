Folks,

The area of Networked Appliances has received much attention in recent months.
Networked Appliances of the future will be 'plug and play' and many will be
portable, raising a large number of architectural, protocol and configuration
issues.  Some of these issues have been highlighted in recent Internet Drafts
and these are available (with a FAQ) at the Networked Appliances web page at:

http://www.argreenhouse.com/iapp/

To enable further open discussion on this topic at IETF 49, there will be an
informal BoF at lunchtime on Tuesday (Dec. 12).  If you are interested in
attending, please reply to Stan Moyer (stanm@research.telcordia.com) or myself
(stsang@research.telcordia.com).  We can plan to meet at noon in the terminal
room (or some other likely meeting place) and I (or Stan) will make reservations
at a nearby restaurant for the group (which is why your RSVP is necessary).

I hope to hear from you soon and to see you at the BoF.

Best Regards,
Simon

Folks,

Stan Moyer has a 10 minute slot at the Zeroconf WG meeting on Monday, 11 Dec in
which he will briefly talk about the topic of Networked Appliances.  I will also
be attending the session, and we will both be available for questions.  I look
forward to seeing you there.

Thanks,
Simon

Dear all,

I have the pleasure to react to the 6th version of the zeroconf requirements.
My background is home networking for consumer devices. Below I first 
give some motivation for the suggestions that follow afterwards.

Motivation.

It is expected that home networks will be composed of several links provided by different manufacturers. 
It will not be uncommon that an IEEE 1394  local link is connected to HiperLAN or HomeRF.
Nevertheless the user of the home network sees his set of interconnected devices as one network.
This is made clear in the present requirements of the ZeroConf WG.

The home will be connected to the outside world via broadcast media, telephone connections or
other internet providers.
The configuration inside the home should not unnecessarily propagate to the outside world.
Vice versa, the connection or disconnection of the home to the outside world should not perturb current
connections. Such a (dis)connections may mean that part of the devices in the home  frequently
change between managed addressing and unmanaged addressing. A change in addressing involves that a 
given host can be known with different addresses to different communication partners.

It should be absolutely certain that two boxes from different suppliers conform to
the same behaviour. Therefore, the possible configurations should be minimised.
For example: According to the IP standard two subnets can coexist on one link-local network.
This can give rise to different behaviours dependent on the interpretation of the
implementor of the standard. Therefore I recommend to restrict the number of
possible configurations and states as much as possible and to restrict a home network to
one IP subnet.

________________________________________________________________________________________________-

Suggestions:

page 3 section 1.5

I understand the term "broadcast" to mean "broadcast provided by the physical medium"

Modify a requirements:
- protocols intended to span at least one IP subnet should not use broadcasts 
or link-local addressing

Add a requirement:

Requirement;
- A ZeroConf protocol spans at least one IP subnet.
- A ZeroConf protocol can modify or add the addressses of hosts that are connected to at most one subnet

Section 2.1 

after the "terms" part,  add the following requirements:

Requirement:
- Two hosts are situated on different subnets if and only if all paths between them 
pass through a router.
- Two hosts are situated on the same subnet if there is a path over the same link, or a
path via one or more bridges without routers.

Section 2.1.2

Definition:
- Two hosts are connected if and only if there is a path between them.
- A communication between two hosts is perturbed if the requirements on the connection
 are not met.

Requirement:
- The installation or removal of a bridge or router does not perturb
the communication between hosts that are connected before and after the topology change.

Requirement:
- A host can support one or more IP addressses on the same network interface.

Thanks for your comments.

While the work of the working group goes on, and any constructive 
discussion is still welcome, work on this *specific* document is 
complete, and it is only in the most extreme circumstances that further 
changes would be considered.

Where there are multiple link technologies, there must be some box to 
connect those links together. Such boxes exist today -- one example I 
know well is the Apple AirPort base station, which includes an IP router 
to forward packets, and a DHCP server to configure clients. While 
zeroconf considers this case, the focus is on making IP work on networks 
where there is *no* supporting infrastructure.

>The home will be connected to the outside world

This is not the focus of the working group. While the home *might* be 
connected to the outside world, the focus of the working group is 
ensuring that IP continues to work even when the home network is not 
connected to the outside world.

Dear Stuart,

Thank you for your very quick answer.

You mention that work on this specific document is complete.
Does that mean that work on version 6 is complete or work
on the requirements is complete?

I understand that boxes are necessary to connect two or more links together.
It is nice to know that work in this direction has been done already.
I understand that the work of the group is on requirements. I think that the
addition of a DHCP server in such a box is not really an issue for the requirements.

We, at philips research, are worried that a DHCP server may become a necessity in zeroconf networks.
Without a DHCP server  two or more links can be interconnected at relatively low costs. 
Also we are afraid that the presence of a DHCP server needs setting up of the server by the user.
Therefore we encourage the requirements to be formulated such that a DHCP server is not needed.

We hope that the requirement on the connection box is such that the addressing of hosts
on connected links is defined unambiguously. I tried to
make clear with my additions that adressing through a router is different 
from addressing through a bridge. Also dependent on
router or bridge functionality a different set of addresses of the hosts can be
expected at the moment the bridge(router) is connected or disconnected.

Further I understand that the ZeroConf group looks at the survivability of a network
when it is not connected to the outside world. I think that also involves requirements
on the network behaviour when a link to the oustside world is inserted or removed.

We think that "in home networks" will be confronted by frequent and multiple
connections and disconnecteions to the outside world. For example, this follows from many
scenarios that involve access to the home from a mobile phone or access from the
home to a movie distributor or a game provider.

I hope I made my point of view clear and also showed the importance of the issues
I try to address in the context of home networks.

Unfortunately, I will not be at the WG meeting this week. If you think it worthwhile
that my concerns are discussed more extensively with one or more WG members, I will be pleased
to do so.

Greetings

The requirements document is complete - it has gone through
WG last call.  The only comments we are considering now are
those which the WG agreed to in the last call period or where
someone discovers something which is terribly wrong with the
document.  It is only by adopting such processes that the IETF
can make progress with documents and complete its work.

Please feel free to comment on and submit individual contribution
internet drafts on this topic.  Others have done so - see 

draft-zeroconf-<author names>

Comments on these documents are also welcome on this mailing list.
The WG charter currently does not include any goals for coordinating
what some have called 'mini-DHCP servers'.  This could change in the
future, but we would need to have a lot of discussion and arrive at
a broad agreement in the WG on goals and issues before broadening
our charter.

Erik
