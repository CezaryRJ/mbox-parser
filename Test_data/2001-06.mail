The internet draft "ZeroConf Requirements", draft-ietf-zeroconf-reqts-08.txt
is now in WG LAST CALL.  Please send comments to the mailing list before
June 19.  

This is the second WG last call for this document.  Issues arising from the
first WG last call have been addressed in this version.  Changes since then
are largely rewording, clarifications and some changes to the multicast
address allocation requirements and security considerations wording.  

Regards,

Folks,

We need reviews of the following documents.  

ftp://ftp.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-ietf-zeroconf-zmaap-01.txt
ftp://ftp.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-ietf-zeroconf-zmaap-api-00.txt

----

Changes since draft-00 of ZMAAP are:

1) Simplified presentation and protocol rules.
2) Caching is different: hosts MAY cache other's AIUs but need not
3) Attempts at compatibility with AAP has been dropped
4) API issues are considered
5) Session management implications added - including interaction
   with SAP and SDP
6) All allocations use relative, not absolute times

One suggestion, which the authors pursued, then rejected, was the
notion of having no lifetimes for allocations.  This would mean
that addresses only would be considered allocated if there were
one or more active defenders & simplify the protocol.  

This worked in principal, but made caching of allocations 
impossible.  In the case of link local IPv4 multicast addresses, 
we will likely only be able to allocate a small number (there are 
only about 200 free addresses of this kind total).  In this case, 
caching is imperative:  You would have to be able to keep track 
of which addresses were allocated so you could pick a 
likely-to-be-non-conflicting one to claim.

The API document is derived from the Abstract Multicast Allocation 
API, RFC 2771.  The document describes new abstract APIs and how
certain RFC 2771 APIs do not apply.  There are also two concrete
APIs (for C and Java).

That is the specification of this protocol over IPv4.  You should also
read RFC 2462 which describes link-local autoconfiguration for IPv6.
(You need to read RFC 2461 and 2373 too, to make sense of 2462).

> This document describes that a ipv4 link-local addresses is used all the

That is the recommended behavior in draft-ietf-zeroconf-ipv4-linklocal-02.txt.

> and if a host using ipv4 link-local address searchs a DHCP and allocates a
> globally unique ipv4 address, does the host still use a link-local address?

This is the desirable behavior.  Then local communication will continue
uninterrupted whether a DHCP server appears on the network or not.

The working group last call period for the internet draft 
"ZeroConf Requirements", draft-ietf-zeroconf-reqts-08.txt,
has completed.  

Result:  There were no comments.  

Summary: This latest revision contained only rewordings 
         and rearrangement due to the previous WG last 
         call (on draft -05, last September).  The WG
         chairs wanted to provide the opportunity for
         community comment on those changes.

Next:    This document will be submitted to the IESG for
         consideration to publish as an Informational RFC.

draft-ietf-zeroconf-zmaap-01.txt provides the following capabilities:

ZMAAP allows an application to allocate an address which will be
defended.  In addition the application can 'share defense' of
an address allocated elsewhere.

In the case of a conflict (which can occur either because 
some ZMAAP packets are lost or due to fusion of two previously
isolated networks), one or more of the allocations will be
abandoned, and new addresses will have to be allocated.

*** How can members of a session rediscover it after a conflict
*** at a newly allocated multicast address?

draft-ietf-zeroconf-zmaap-01.txt suggests that hosts should discover 
sessions by listen for SAP announcements, which will contain a 'zmaap 
lease-id' SDP attribute.  This will enable rendezvous initially and 
at subsequent multicast group allocations.  

*** The problem with this approach is that SAP advertisements 
*** occur very seldom.  SAP is not suited for short-lived (ad hoc) 
*** local-area session discovery.  RFC 2974 puts it this way:
 
   SAP is intended to announce the existence of long-lived wide-area
   multicast sessions.  It is not an especially timely protocol:
   sessions are announced by periodic multicast with a repeat rate on
   the order of tens of minutes, and no enhanced reliability over UDP.
   This leads to a long startup delay before a complete set of
   announcements is heard by a listener.  This delay is clearly
   undesirable for interactive browsing of announced sessions.

An alternative for session discovery is needed, which allows
prompt rendezvous after a conflict and rapid browsing of 
available sessions.  Alternatives I can think of are:

(1) Add a SDR attribute list to address-in-use (AIU) messages.
    AIUs are retransmitted before the 'lease-lifetime' expires.  
    This lifetime can be from 1 second - ~18 hours.  If lifetimes
    of ~1 minute were used, session discovery would be pretty
    prompt:  Session caches could be used for browsing.  
 
    This approach uses a lot of bandwidth and increases processing
    and storage requirements of mini-MAASs.  Further, ZMAAP becomes
    a session discovery *AND* address allocation protocol.

(2) Add a new ZMAAP session request and session reply message.
    These would contain a list of SDR attributes.  A reply
    would be sent if it matched the attributes in the session
    request.

    This approach doesn't use much network or system resources,
    but it complicates ZMAAP.  Further, ZMAAP becomes a 
    session discovery *AND* address allocation protocol.  Finally,
    there already exists an IETF standard discovery protocol, SLP.

(3) SLP could be used to discover multicast sessions.

    This adds a requirement on SLP to support ZMAAP.  SLP has not
    previously be used for multicast session discovery.  

(4) In the limited context of the scopes supported by ZMAAP
    SAP could be defined so that it sends more frequent advertisements
    (on the order of 10s of seconds instead of 10s of minutes).

    SAP is an Experimental protocol - meaning we could not base a
    standards track protocol (ZMAAP) on it. 

What do you think of these alternatives?  

I am inclined to (4).  Given the limited discussion of ZMAAP, 
perhaps it should be issued as an Experimental RFC.  In this
case relying on SAP would not be an issue.
