Clarion Hotel claims Huge cut in energy cost due to E t GU

Thanksgivings top five points you should be considering:

1. Global and domestic energy problems are rampant and taking their toll
on businesses worldwide. 
2. Without much relief in site from authorities, businesses are looking
for their own solutions to energy problems.
3. With reductions as large as thirty percent, SensorStat has become a
shelter from the energy storm. 
4. One facility after another is boasting the huge savings et g U's
SensorStat has brought to their business.
5. EnerBrite will be releasing more news in a media campaign this coming
week.

Heavy trading got etgU moving hard all week. Wednesday and Friday saw a
giant push, to cut pricing and grab large blocks of shares in
expectation of next weeks trading. Get in early on Monday before the
price climbs back up and take advantage of the spread.
