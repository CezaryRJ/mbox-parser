Hi Everybody,

I am very new in this area. I wanted to know is there
any implemetation of zeroconf for linux...while
searching on net I got zcip on
/pub/Linux/kernel.org/pub/software/network/zcip
. 
I downloaded this and compiled on redHat 7.1..

Now I don't know how to configure my m/c for
automatically assigning IP address.. I tried to run
zcip from command prompt 
it is running in loop probing for different ip-address
of series 169.254.x.x giving message address in
use....and unable to get IP address.

My machine is already on a network with dhcp
server...is this the reason for not getting IP using
zeroconf....How to test zcip....

Any other implementation for zeroconf for Linux....

Thanks in Advance..

Shaily

Hi, i'm the author of zcip.  It hasn't received very extensive
testing yet, though it works fine for us internally and i've verified
interoperability with a bunch of flavors of Windows.


zcip should work just fine on a network with a dhcp server, that's how
i do most of my testing.  (Of course if there's a dhcp server you're
probably better off using that to get your IP configuration.)


To help me debug the problem you're having, please run the following
commands and mail me all of the output:

    ifconfig
    route
    zcip


I also need to see a packet trace of zcip running, ie run "tcpdump -l -n"
before starting zcip, and mail me the output of that, too.




We'll get you going!




Sebastian

I've been looking at the zcip implementation, and have a couple of questions, 
a comment, and a request. The questions are about how the IETF draft is 
supposed to be implemented, so this is at least partly on-topic.

These questions are against the zcip-1 code that I recently got off a 
kernel.org mirror. They may not represent the current state of the code

Q1. The zcip code doesn't support multi-homing (aka IP aliasing, having more 
than one virtual interface (including IP) on a single physical network device 
yet, but I'd like to make it work in the near future. Which of the section 3 
choices (link local on one interface, shared link-local address, unique 
link-local address on all interfaces) is expected?

Q2. I am worried about existing interoperability problems. Is it expected that 
major vendors (especially Microsoft) will release service packs or patches to 
ensure conformance? Or is it worth adding a non-default option to defend more 
agressively?

C1. For people who tried running zcip-1, and had the "infinite fast loop" 
problem, where zcip seemed to find immediate conflicts on every address, you 
need to configure your kernel to support packet filtering (CONFIG_FILTER) in 
the networking options area. Then rebuild. Vendor kernels seem to have this 
turned on, and Linus kernels have it turned off.

R1. Could the author of zcip get in contact with me? I have a patch adding 
documentation and some minor code changes that I'd like to get incorporated.

Hi, i'm the author of zcip.  Sorry there's no contact info in the
zcip tarball, i'm still waiting for the mailing list to be set up on
kernel.org.  Version 1 is the current top of tree.

I think "multi-homed" is used in the draft to mean a host with multiple
physical network interfaces, not a host with multiple IP addresses on
a single physical interface.  See figures 1 and 2.

I dont know what Microsoft's plans are.


I assume you're talking about the W2K/WXP aggressive claim behavior?
It would probably make sense to observe a pair of W2K/WXP hosts collide
and see how they defend the claim, then add a flag to mimic that behavior.


If someone sends me this information i'll add the "defend from WXP"
flag to zcip.

Cool, that's what going on.  I'll add a check for this kernel feature
and print an informative error message if it's missing.

I'd be pleased to receive your patches.

Mea culpa :-(. Ignore the multi-home reference, and go with the "having
more than one virtual interface (including IP) on a single physical
network device" description.

I only know of it from your README, but am philosphically opposed to having 
anyone beat up on my Linux box :-)

Patch provided off-list.

Thanks for the fast response!

Hello everyone, i'm not sure if it's acceptable to post software
announcements to this list, but here it goes.


I've release a new version of zcip, an implementation of the IETF draft
"Dynamic Configuration of IPv4 Link-Local Addresses" for Linux and
Unix-like operating systems.


Version 2 includes a bunch of documentation and some code changes from
Brad Hards.  Grab it at:

I skimmed recent posts and could not understand for sure whats the
current
link-local draft state ... the current draft seems to be the 04 version
and expiration date of January ...

I saw the 'summary of issues...' post from November ...=20

Is there any idea if and when link-local will become an RFC?

Thanks
   -Nevo
