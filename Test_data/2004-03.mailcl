The IESG has concluded a review of the IPv4LL spec.  The following
new issues will be discussed over the next week.  It is not
anticipated that these will be controversial issues.  If an issue
does not elicit debate, I will assume that the suggested change
will be adopted.

LL41 Broadcast text for IPv4 LL
LL42 Category inconsistency for DNS / IPv4LL prohibition
LL43 Clarify rules for use of LL vs routeable addresses
LL44 Clarify higher layer protocol considerations
LL45 Embellish text coping with scoped addresses
LL46 Text implies limited applicability
LL47 IESG nits
LL48 Some security section text should be relocated
LL49 Lower case 2 MUSTs
LL50 Simple forwarding rule text needs caveat
LL51 Embellish Address Ambiguity problem statement

Please post your responses to these issues to the zeroconf mailing
list in the next week, ending 24 Mar 04.

Thanks,

Erik Guttman
Zeroconf WG chair

Description of Issue: Broadcast text for IPv4 LL
Submitter Name:       Bill Fenner & Margaret Wasserman
Submitter Email:      
Date submitted:       Feb 20, 2004
Reference:

Priority (S must, 1 Should, 2 May fix): 1
Section:               2.6.2
Rationale/Explanation: 

Bill Fenner wrote:
2.6.2 says

  ...if the destination address is in the
  169.254/16 prefix (including the 169.254.255.255 broadcast address),
  then the sender MUST ARP for the destination address and then send
  its packet directly to the destination on the same physical link.

This sounds like it's saying that 169.254.255.255 is not to be treated
as a broadcast address, but it describes it as "the .. broadcast
address".  Potentially confusing.

This is not a DISCUSS because this is a relatively minor issue in a
document that I don't want to prevent from moving forward, but if it
is going to be spun for something else (or even if this can be handled
in AUTH48) I'd be happier.

Margaret Wasserman wrote:

  In section 2.6.2 "Forwarding Rules", the document says:

  "Whichever interface is used, if the destination address is in the
  169.254/16 prefix (including the 169.254.255.255 broadcast address),
  then the sender MUST ARP for the destination address and then send
  its packet directly to the destination on the same physical link.
  This MUST be done whether the interface is configured with a Link-
  Local or a routable IPv4 address."

      I don't think that the above paragraph is intended to indicate
      that an ARP should be sent for every link-local packet, but
      it could be read that way.  In particular, it doesn't seem
      correct to ARP for a broadcast address.  Also, it should be
      okay (AFAIK) to use a normal ARP cache for these addresses,
      right?

Long Description:
Proposed Change:

Omit 'broadcast address' in the text above - which becomes:

  ...if the destination address is in the
  169.254/16 prefix (excluding the address 169.254.255.255, which is
  the broadcast address for the Link-Local prefix), then the sender 
  MUST ARP for the destination address and then send its packet 
  directly to the destination on the same physical link.

Section 1.4 says :

  c. Link-Local IPv4 addresses MUST NOT be configured in the DNS.


Section 2.9 says:

  As Link-Local IPv4 addresses may change at any time and have limited
  scope, storing Link-Local IPv4 addresses in the DNS is not well
  understood and is NOT RECOMMENDED.

RFC 2119, Section 4, says "NOT RECOMMENDED" is the same strength
as "SHOULD NOT".  The authors and working group need to decide
whether this prohibition is a MUST or a SHOULD.

Margaret Wasserman wrote:
        This document says, at one point, that storing LL addresses
        in the DNS is not recommended.  But, later it says that
        you MUST NOT store LL addresses in the DNS.  Which is it?
Proposed Change:

Change section 2.9 to be 'MUST NOT'.  The decision to for the MUST
NOT text in section 1.4 was made after Section 2.9.  The new text
for section 2.9 would be:

  As Link-Local IPv4 addresses may change at any time and have limited
  scope, Link-Local IPv4 address MUST NOT be stored in the DNS.

Rationale/Explanation: 
Long Description:
The draft has the following text in section 1.4:

  a. Routable addresses should be used within applications whenever
  they are available.

  b. Names that are globally resolvable to routable addresses should be
  used within applications whenever they are available.  Names that are
  resolvable only on the local link (such as through use of protocols
  such as Link Local Multicast Name Resolution [LLMNR]) MUST NOT be
  used in off-link communication.  IPV4 addresses and names which can
  only be resolved on the local link SHOULD NOT be forwarded, they
  SHOULD only be sent when a Link-Local address is used as the source
  address.  This strong advice should hinder limited scope addresses
  and names from leaving the context in which they apply.

  c. Link-Local IPv4 addresses MUST NOT be configured in the DNS.

A & B seem to contain contrary advice (Use routable addresses in
applications vs.  use names resolvable to routable addresses in
applciations); this is probably because the authors see an "instead"
in here that isn't stated.  I'd suggest rephrasing A.  I'd also
suggest reversing the order so that C is first (it is the MUST here),
B's advice is next (It is the SHOULD), and then the current A is "If
names resolvable to globally routable addresses are not available, but
the globally routable addresses are, they should be used instead of
link-local addresses".

Proposed Change:

Replace a-c in 1.4 with

  a. Link-Local IPv4 addresses MUST NOT be configured in the DNS.

  b. If names resolvable to globally routable addresses are not 
  available, but the globally routable addresses are, they should 
  be used instead of link-local addresses
  
  c. Names that are globally resolvable to routable addresses should be
  used within applications whenever they are available.  Names that are
  resolvable only on the local link (such as through use of protocols
  such as Link Local Multicast Name Resolution [LLMNR]) MUST NOT be
  used in off-link communication.  IPV4 addresses and names which can
  only be resolved on the local link SHOULD NOT be forwarded, they
  SHOULD only be sent when a Link-Local address is used as the source
  address.  This strong advice should hinder limited scope addresses
  and names from leaving the context in which they apply.

Folks,

We need to determine if a change is needed for section 2.9.  Hopefully
Ted can clarify what exactly he wants changed in the next week.  If no
decision is reached on a change by March 24, 2004 - this issue will be
rejected.

Section:              2.9
Rationale/Explanation: 
Long Description:

Section 2.9 says:

2.9.  Higher-Layer Protocol Considerations

  Similar considerations apply at layers above IP.

I think it would be valuable to say "Consideration similar to those in
Section XX apply at layers above IP", in case this text is excerpted
or the Higher-layer protocol consideration reader does not follow.
I'm also uneasy at the SHOULDs in this, and I have called out one
conflict in the text on the DNS front as a DISCUSS.  Basically,
though, the APPs layer should not need to know which interface is
being used for a specific operation, and that may not be the case
here. There are actually two risks here: that a reference to a
link-local address by an application will break because the entity
dereferencing it will not have access to that link-local address and
that an application will receive the wrong data because it can
dereference *something* at that address (possibly on a different
interface), but it is not the intended referent.  This is implied in
Sections 3.2 and 6.3, and forward references to those section here
would be useful in addition to the other references.

Proposed Change:

{text is needed}

The text reads as if we don't know how to work with scoped addresses
at all. This is not true. We know that:

  1. The IP stack must have the outbound interface associated with
    a packet that needs to be sent to a LL destination address

  2. The outbound interface cannot be derived from the packet's
    header parameters such as src or dst address (e.g. by using
    the forwarding table lookup), hence

  3. Outbound interface association MUST be done explicitly
    through other means. The specification does not stipulate
    those means, but examples include ...

  Given that the IP stack must have the outbound interface associated 
  with a packet that needs to be sent to a LL destination address, 
  interface selection must occur.  The outbound interface cannot be 
  derived from the packet's header parameters such as src or dst address 
  (e.g. by using the forwarding table lookup).  Therefore, outbound
  interface association MUST be done explicitly through other means. 
  The specification does not stipulate those means.

Ralph,

the current tracker is at
http://www.drizzle.org/~aboba/ZEROCONF/issues.html


The latest set of issues will be posted in the next 24 hours.
Currently all issues in the tracker are resolved.  We have 
completed IETF last call and made the requested very minor
clarifying changes.  All we have ahead of us is responding to
the comments from the IESG.  I will post the remaining issues
to the list in the next few hours as time permits.

Erik

Change to MUST NOT is appropriate and consistent.

802.1x also interferes here.

What we should be saying is that 802 hardware link change appropriate for 
media type and security policy mechanisms all apply. I haven't formulated 
words for this, however what I'm getting at is any wireless or wired 
network implementing access mechanisms may affect the ability of an end 
station to get a usable IP address (whether RFC1918/NAT or public, but 
not-LL) pending authentication, media access control (association with an 
access point, peer-to-peer wireless, wired connection, etc.) and so forth. 
Let's try to avoid references to wires other than as an example of a 
transition that might trigger an event.

If the change was to add RFC 2434 as an informative reference, would
this satisfy your concern?

Thanks,

Section:               5, 2.5
Rationale/Explanation: 
Long Description:

        The "Security Considerations" section contains the following
        band-aid that should have been included in the earlier text
        that describes how to handle address collision:

  "Implementations and users should also note that a node that gives up
  an address and reconfigures, as required by section 2.5, allows the
  possibility that another node can easily successfully hijack existing
  TCP connections. Before abandoning an address due to a conflict,
  hosts SHOULD actively attempt to reset any existing connections using
  that address."

Proposed Change:

Section 5 text changes from:

   Implementations and users should also note that a node that gives up
   an address and reconfigures, as required by section 2.5, allows the
   possibility that another node can easily successfully hijack existing
   TCP connections. Before abandoning an address due to a conflict,
   hosts SHOULD actively attempt to reset any existing connections using
   that address.

   Implementations and users should also note that a node that gives up
   an address and reconfigures, as required by section 2.5, allows the
   possibility that another node can easily successfully hijack existing
   TCP connections. 

Section 2.5 text changes from:

It is not possible for two
   different hosts using the same IP address on the same network to
   operate reliably.

   Immediately configuring a new address as soon as the conflict is
   detected is the best way to restore useful communication as quickly
   as possible.

The two "MUST" above should be lower case.

Proposed Change:

from:

     Microsoft Windows 98 (and later) and Mac OS 8.5 (and later) already
     support this capability.  This document standardizes usage,
     prescribing rules for how Link-Local IPv4 addresses MUST be treated
     by hosts and routers.  In particular, it describes how routers MUST
     behave when receiving packets with IPv4 Link-Local addresses in the
     source or destination address.  With respect to hosts, it discusses

Mentioning that this won't work for multihomed hosts and routers and
pointing
to the section discussing this would be useful.

Proposed Change:

Change text from:

   In many network stacks, achieving this functionality may be as simple
   as adding a routing table entry indicating that 169.254/16 is
   directly reachable on the local link.

To:

   In many network stacks, achieving this functionality may be as simple
   as adding a routing table entry indicating that 169.254/16 is
   directly reachable on the local link.  This approach will not work
for
   routers or multihomed hosts.  Refer to section 3 for more discussion
   of multihomed hosts.

I would add that even if a given LL address is resolved using just one
link at a given moment, the choice will still be ambiguous without
interface specification, as a second later another host with the same
LL address may become available on another link.

Proposed Change:

Change from:

3.2.  Address Ambiguity

   This is a core problem with respect to Link-Local IPv4 addresses
   configured on more than one interface. What should a host do when it
   needs to send to Link-Local destination L and L can be resolved using
   ARP on more than one link?

To:

3.2.  Address Ambiguity

   This is a core problem with respect to Link-Local IPv4 addresses
   configured on more than one interface. What should a host do when it
   needs to send to Link-Local destination L and L can be resolved using
   ARP on more than one link?  
   
   Even if the address L can be resolved on only one link at a given
   moment, there is no guarantee that it will   remain unambiguous in 
   the future.  Additional hosts on other interfaces may claim the 
   address L as well.

This change certainly addresses my concern.  The key detail is
changing "including" to "excluding".  I'm not subscribed to the

Alternative:
Microsoft Windows 98 (and later) and Mac OS 8.5 (and later) already
support this capability.  This document standardizes usage,
prescribing rules for how Link-Local IPv4 addresses are to be treated
by hosts and routers.  In particular, it describes how routers are to
behave when receiving packets with IPv4 Link-Local addresses in the
source or destination address.  With respect to hosts, it discusses
claiming and defending addresses, maintaining Link-Local and
routable IPv4 addresses on the same interface, and multihoming issues.

Personally, I don't think any of these changes are necessary - this =
clearly appears in an "examples include" section and the next line =
mentions wireless networking. Anyone who cannot extrapolate from =
examples will not get far with this or any other standard.

I am happy with any of the proposed changes but lets not get bogged =

In general I agree with you. But since the issue was raised in IESG review, 
I figured we might as well tweak the text to further clarify and make folks 
happy.

Bill Fenner wrote:
2.6.2 says

  ...if the destination address is in the
  169.254/16 prefix (including the 169.254.255.255 broadcast address),
  then the sender MUST ARP for the destination address and then send
  its packet directly to the destination on the same physical link.

This sounds like it's saying that 169.254.255.255 is not to be treated
as a broadcast address, but it describes it as "the .. broadcast
address".  Potentially confusing.

This is not a DISCUSS because this is a relatively minor issue in a
document that I don't want to prevent from moving forward, but if it
is going to be spun for something else (or even if this can be handled
in AUTH48) I'd be happier.

Margaret Wasserman wrote:

  In section 2.6.2 "Forwarding Rules", the document says:

  "Whichever interface is used, if the destination address is in the
  169.254/16 prefix (including the 169.254.255.255 broadcast address),
  then the sender MUST ARP for the destination address and then send
  its packet directly to the destination on the same physical link.
  This MUST be done whether the interface is configured with a Link-
  Local or a routable IPv4 address."

      I don't think that the above paragraph is intended to indicate
      that an ARP should be sent for every link-local packet, but
      it could be read that way.  In particular, it doesn't seem
      correct to ARP for a broadcast address.  Also, it should be
      okay (AFAIK) to use a normal ARP cache for these addresses,
      right?

Long Description:
Proposed Change:

Omit 'broadcast address' in the text above - which becomes:

  ...if the destination address is in the
  169.254/16 prefix (excluding the address 169.254.255.255, which is
  the broadcast address for the Link-Local prefix), then the sender 
  MUST ARP for the destination address and then send its packet 
  directly to the destination on the same physical link.

Section 1.4 says :

  c. Link-Local IPv4 addresses MUST NOT be configured in the DNS.


Section 2.9 says:

  As Link-Local IPv4 addresses may change at any time and have limited
  scope, storing Link-Local IPv4 addresses in the DNS is not well
  understood and is NOT RECOMMENDED.

RFC 2119, Section 4, says "NOT RECOMMENDED" is the same strength
as "SHOULD NOT".  The authors and working group need to decide
whether this prohibition is a MUST or a SHOULD.

Margaret Wasserman wrote:
        This document says, at one point, that storing LL addresses
        in the DNS is not recommended.  But, later it says that
        you MUST NOT store LL addresses in the DNS.  Which is it?
Proposed Change:

Change section 2.9 to be 'MUST NOT'.  The decision to for the MUST
NOT text in section 1.4 was made after Section 2.9.  The new text
for section 2.9 would be:

  As Link-Local IPv4 addresses may change at any time and have limited
  scope, Link-Local IPv4 address MUST NOT be stored in the DNS.

Description of Issue: Clarify rules for use of LL vs routeable addresses

Section:               1.4
Rationale/Explanation: 
Long Description:
The draft has the following text in section 1.4:

  a. Routable addresses should be used within applications whenever
  they are available.

  b. Names that are globally resolvable to routable addresses should be
  used within applications whenever they are available.  Names that are
  resolvable only on the local link (such as through use of protocols
  such as Link Local Multicast Name Resolution [LLMNR]) MUST NOT be
  used in off-link communication.  IPV4 addresses and names which can
  only be resolved on the local link SHOULD NOT be forwarded, they
  SHOULD only be sent when a Link-Local address is used as the source
  address.  This strong advice should hinder limited scope addresses
  and names from leaving the context in which they apply.

  c. Link-Local IPv4 addresses MUST NOT be configured in the DNS.

A & B seem to contain contrary advice (Use routable addresses in
applications vs.  use names resolvable to routable addresses in
applciations); this is probably because the authors see an "instead"
in here that isn't stated.  I'd suggest rephrasing A.  I'd also
suggest reversing the order so that C is first (it is the MUST here),
B's advice is next (It is the SHOULD), and then the current A is "If
names resolvable to globally routable addresses are not available, but
the globally routable addresses are, they should be used instead of
link-local addresses".

Proposed Change:

Replace a-c in 1.4 with

  a. Link-Local IPv4 addresses MUST NOT be configured in the DNS.

  b. If names resolvable to globally routable addresses are not 
  available, but the globally routable addresses are, they should 
  be used instead of link-local addresses
  
  c. Names that are globally resolvable to routable addresses should be
  used within applications whenever they are available.  Names that are
  resolvable only on the local link (such as through use of protocols
  such as Link Local Multicast Name Resolution [LLMNR]) MUST NOT be
  used in off-link communication.  IPV4 addresses and names which can
  only be resolved on the local link SHOULD NOT be forwarded, they
  SHOULD only be sent when a Link-Local address is used as the source
  address.  This strong advice should hinder limited scope addresses
  and names from leaving the context in which they apply.

Reject this change.  The risks are presented already in the
document.  This request for clarification amounts to more
pointers which are not strictly required if the entire document

Section:              2.9
Rationale/Explanation: 
Long Description:

Section 2.9 says:

2.9.  Higher-Layer Protocol Considerations

  Similar considerations apply at layers above IP.

I think it would be valuable to say "Consideration similar to those in
Section XX apply at layers above IP", in case this text is excerpted
or the Higher-layer protocol consideration reader does not follow.
I'm also uneasy at the SHOULDs in this, and I have called out one
conflict in the text on the DNS front as a DISCUSS.  Basically,
though, the APPs layer should not need to know which interface is
being used for a specific operation, and that may not be the case
here. There are actually two risks here: that a reference to a
link-local address by an application will break because the entity
dereferencing it will not have access to that link-local address and
that an application will receive the wrong data because it can
dereference *something* at that address (possibly on a different
interface), but it is not the intended referent.  This is implied in
Sections 3.2 and 6.3, and forward references to those section here
would be useful in addition to the other references.

Proposed Change:

{text is needed}

The text reads as if we don't know how to work with scoped addresses
at all. This is not true. We know that:

  1. The IP stack must have the outbound interface associated with
    a packet that needs to be sent to a LL destination address

  2. The outbound interface cannot be derived from the packet's
    header parameters such as src or dst address (e.g. by using
    the forwarding table lookup), hence

  3. Outbound interface association MUST be done explicitly
    through other means. The specification does not stipulate
    those means, but examples include ...

  Given that the IP stack must have the outbound interface associated 
  with a packet that needs to be sent to a LL destination address, 
  interface selection must occur.  The outbound interface cannot be 
  derived from the packet's header parameters such as src or dst address 
  (e.g. by using the forwarding table lookup).  Therefore, outbound
  interface association MUST be done explicitly through other means. 
  The specification does not stipulate those means.

The two "MUST" above should be lower case.

Proposed Change:

from:

     Microsoft Windows 98 (and later) and Mac OS 8.5 (and later) already
     support this capability.  This document standardizes usage,
     prescribing rules for how Link-Local IPv4 addresses MUST be treated
     by hosts and routers.  In particular, it describes how routers MUST
     behave when receiving packets with IPv4 Link-Local addresses in the
     source or destination address.  With respect to hosts, it discusses
     claiming and defending addresses, maintaining Link-Local and
routable
     IPv4 addresses on the same interface, and multihoming issues.

Rationale/Explanation: 
Long Description:

        The "Security Considerations" section contains the following
        band-aid that should have been included in the earlier text
        that describes how to handle address collision:

  "Implementations and users should also note that a node that gives up
  an address and reconfigures, as required by section 2.5, allows the
  possibility that another node can easily successfully hijack existing
  TCP connections. Before abandoning an address due to a conflict,
  hosts SHOULD actively attempt to reset any existing connections using
  that address."

Proposed Change:

Section 5 text changes from:

   Implementations and users should also note that a node that gives up
   an address and reconfigures, as required by section 2.5, allows the
   possibility that another node can easily successfully hijack existing
   TCP connections. Before abandoning an address due to a conflict,
   hosts SHOULD actively attempt to reset any existing connections using
   that address.

   an address and reconfigures, as required by section 2.5, allows the
   possibility that another node can easily successfully hijack existing
   TCP connections. 

Section 2.5 text changes from:

   It is not possible for two
   different hosts using the same IP address on the same network to
   operate reliably.

   Immediately configuring a new address as soon as the conflict is
   detected is the best way to restore useful communication as quickly
   as possible.

I would add that even if a given LL address is resolved using just one
link at a given moment, the choice will still be ambiguous without
interface specification, as a second later another host with the same
LL address may become available on another link.

Proposed Change:

Change from:

3.2.  Address Ambiguity

   This is a core problem with respect to Link-Local IPv4 addresses
   configured on more than one interface. What should a host do when it
   needs to send to Link-Local destination L and L can be resolved using
   ARP on more than one link?

To:

3.2.  Address Ambiguity

   This is a core problem with respect to Link-Local IPv4 addresses
   configured on more than one interface. What should a host do when it
   needs to send to Link-Local destination L and L can be resolved using
   ARP on more than one link?  
   
   Even if the address L can be resolved on only one link at a given
   moment, there is no guarantee that it will   remain unambiguous in 
   the future.  Additional hosts on other interfaces may claim the 
   address L as well.

Mentioning that this won't work for multihomed hosts and routers and
pointing
to the section discussing this would be useful.

for
   routers or multihomed hosts.  Refer to section 3 for more discussion
