I'm glad you asked :-)

As a result of IETF Last-Call on Draft-04, a number of issues were 
raised. The "Summary of Issues" email thread in November proposed 
resolutions to all those issues.

Also, in the DHC Working Group at the Salt-Lake City IETF meeting, one of 
our Area Directors made a very valid observation -- that waiting 8-10 
seconds before using an IP address may be unacceptable for many new 
devices that wish to use Zeroconf. If the Working Group is in agreement, 
I think we can address this concern with the addition of the following 
text:

I urge anyone with an opinion for or against this text to send mail to 
the list. If we can get consensus on this last remaining timeout 
question, then as soon as I hear from our Area Directors and from Keith 
Moore that they approve of the resolutions to the earlier issues, I can 
submit draft-05 and request that the RFC Editor publish it as a Standards 
Track RFC.

For those eager to see a preview of what draft-05 should look like, the 
current working copy is available at:

I'm not sure what the DHCP reference is supposed to be for. Can you clarify

Is this intended to mean media sense (aka the "link good" light) ?

s/should/SHALL?
and perhaps something along the lines of "waiting not less than 200 
milliseconds" for the interval between ARPs.
I am thinking of devices where we can start this process early in the boot 
cycle, and then do other initialisation things (which might take more than 
200ms), which is something productive to do instead of just sleeping for 
200ms.

Is the initial delay intended to avoid a whole stack of machines starting up 
together crashing down on the poor networking media at once?

Stuart,

We also have major problems with the Timeout value of 8 seconds.
Not so much the 8 seconds at the start, but the 8 seconds after sensing a 
clash is considered
prohibitively long. (It means disruption of ongoing service during 8 
seconds)

I propose not to fix the de resend intervals but keep them open.
A best resend strategy depends on the environment (for example on wired 
IEEE 1394 another strategy can be 
used than on IEEE 802.11(b) while Bluetooth communication is going on with 
a packet loss
probability of 30%.). I understand that a number of resends is specified 
and that a recommendation is done
for ethernet but that every link-local implementation can decide itself on 
the best intervals as function of
communication technology and transmission statistics. (a minimum interval 
may be specified
to avoid overloads).

Greetings

I'm glad you asked :-)

As a result of IETF Last-Call on Draft-04, a number of issues were 
raised. The "Summary of Issues" email thread in November proposed 
resolutions to all those issues.

devices that wish to use Zeroconf. If the Working Group is in agreement,

Such a "future version" of IEEE Spanning Tree Protocol already
exists. It's called 802.1w "Rapid Spanning Tree". If you need more
information, you can correspond with Tony Jeffree.

It's worth remembering that adhoc networking scenarios 
often do not involve switches (e.g. adhoc 802.11 wireless
networks). Adhoc wireless networks do meet the definition of "allowing the
device to determine when the link has become active". 

However, where authentication is required, an initial delay may be
inserted; since authentication may operate separately from ARP, there may
be no way for the ARP module to know what the appropriate time intervals
are in a given situation, just given information about the nature of the
link. 

As a result, it is difficult for one or even two
recommendations to fit all circumstances. I'd note that RFC 2462 takes
the approach of defining the variables involved, such as the number of
transmits (DupAddrDetectTransmits), the retransmission timer interval
(ReTransTimer), and the jitter interval
MAX_RTR_SOLICITATION_DELAY (default of 1 second).

Thanks for you comments Brad.

>Interestingly, this informative response doesn't actually answer the 
>question :)

The answer to this question lies in the hands of the IESG. However, it is 
our sincere expectation that this draft will be sent to the RFC editor 
within a week or two.

>I'm not sure what the DHCP reference is supposed to be for.

Good point. That paragraph came from "draft-cheshire-ipv4-acd-01.txt", 
and I forgot to remove the DHCP reference. Draft-04bis now says, "For a 
desktop machine on Ethernet..."

>Is this intended to mean media sense (aka the "link good" light) ?

No, sadly, the "link good" light is misleading. Even when the link light 
is on, the Ethernet switch at the other end may still be silently 
throwing away all your packets. It's quite annoying.

>Is the initial delay intended to avoid a whole stack of machines 
>starting up together crashing down on the poor networking media at once?

Yes. The document mentions this in "2.2 Claiming a Link-Local Address":

   This initial random delay helps ensure that a
   large number of hosts powered on at the same time do not all send
   their initial probe packets simultaneously.
