Sender: owner-zeroconf@merit.edu
Precedence: bulk

The IETF has been notified that Apple has IPR related to
draft-ietf-zeroconf-linklocal-ipv4-13.txt. The referenced note also
includes licensing terms, consistent with the obligations under RFC 3668.

Implications for the WG:

The WG needs to be take this IPR (and the provided licensing terms)
into consideration and decide how or whether this new IPR issue in
anyway changes the WG's previous decision to request that the IESG
publish the zeroconf document as PS.  Note: the IESG's earlier concerns
with this document have been resolved.  According to the IESG the main
remaining hurdle to having this document approved/published is the IPR
issue that just came up.

Subject: WG status - last minute issues to consider
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii" ; format="flowed"
Sender: owner-zeroconf@merit.edu
Precedence: bulk


WG status:

We have only one item on our charter, the IPv4 LL autoconfiguration
specification.  This document has passed WG and IETF last call and
satisfied all remaining IESG objections.

I have received a set of change requests from Stuart Cheshire.  I am
opening a new set of issues to discuss them.  I summarize them below.

It is of course our continuing desire to publish a high quality
document.  At the same time, I must resist any attempt to reopen
issues which have been resolved at this time.  I make my
recommendations as to what to do which each issue, but I leave it to
you to judge.  We will need a strong consensus to adopt *any* changes
at this point.

Special mention must be made of issue LL67 .  Stuart has found a flaw
in the protocol as specified which would seriously limit the
interoperability of hosts.  I strongly encourage the WG to pay special
attention to this item and to support the change, even if we have to
go through further review.  I believe we overlooked this problem and
it is entirely consistent with the rest of the document to make the
change.

Another issue we need to consider closely is LL61.  Is it really
necessary to add an initial wait interval as per LL31?

Thank you in advance for your engagement over the next week in
discussing the issues I put before you.

Section:			1.4, 1.8
Rationale/Explanation:
Lengthy Description:

[Stuart]

>         IPv4 addresses ...
>       ... which can only be resolved on the local link ...
>       ... SHOULD only be sent when a Link-Local address
>       is used as the source address.

Sent how? In the header? In the payload? Doesn't this contradict the text
later in the document that says:

>    There will be cases when devices with a configured Link-Local address
>    will need to communicate with a device with a routable address
>    configured on the same physical link, and vice versa.  The rules in
>    Section 2.6  allow this communication.

This says that link-local addresses *can* be used when the source address
is *not* link-local.

[Erik]

The IPv4 address would be sent in the LLMNR (DNS) payload.  I though
that was obvious due the the context in the paragraph.

The first paragraph refers to text in section 1.4.b which discuss
limitations of the use of IPv4 LL when used with LLMNR.  The second
paragraph is in section 1.8 which discusses general communication
between two hosts.  In the latter case, the text is definitely
appropriate.

I believe there is no contradiction.  1.4.b does not hinder the use of
LLMNR or IPv4 LL configuration except in one case:  A host implementor
is admonished (using SHOULD) to only hand out a LL address using LLMNR
when the host has a LL configuration and only from an interface which in
fact has been configured with an LL adddress.

[Stuart]

I disagee.

As stated, a device with a routable address, and a link-local-scope name
of some kind, is prohibited from answering queries for that name, because
the name can only be resolved on the local link, but the device doesn't
have a Link-Local address to use as the source IP address.

[Erik]

  The full quote is:

       IPv4 addresses and names which can only be resolved on the local
       link SHOULD NOT be forwarded, they SHOULD only be sent when a
       Link-Local address is used as the source address.  This strong
       advice should hinder limited scope addresses and names from
       leaving the context in which they apply.

     There is no prohibition.  There is only a 'SHOULD' implying that
     this is not a great idea.  The issue of 'leaving the context ni
     which they apply' is not very serious *today* since LLMNR has only
     LL scope.  In the future, LLMNR might be admin scope MNR.  In this
     case, we will need the SHOULD above - so that link-local scope
     identifiers (addresses and names) are properly contained.

Aren't these all now parametrized in Section 9?

[Erik]

Yes, they are parameterized there.  However, the text here describes
what we are doing and why.

[Stuart]

Does "the number of, and interval between, ARP probes" refer to
PROBE_MIN, PROBE_MAX, PROBE_N, or NUM_PROBES? Why not just make it clear?

[Erik]

    Which of the following versions do you prefer?
    See 
http://www.drizzle.org/~aboba/ZEROCONF/draft-ietf-zeroconf-ipv4-linklocal-15.txt 

    in order to make sense of the 'Section references'

     A

    Link-layer technologies that support ARP but operate at rates below 1
    Mbps or latencies above one second may need to specify different
    values for the following parameters described in Sections 2.2.1, 2.4
    and 2.5:

    (a) the number of, and interval between, ARP probes,
    (b) the number of, and interval between, ARP announcements,
    (c) the maximum rate at which address claiming may be attempted, and
    (d) the time interval between conflicting ARPs below which a host
        MUST reconfigure instead of attempting to defend its address.

     B

    Link-layer technologies that support ARP but operate at rates below 1
    Mbps or latencies above one second may need to specify different
    values for the following parameters.

    (a) the number of, and interval between, ARP probes
        See NUM_PROBES, PROBE_MIN, PROBE_MAX defined in section 2.2.1

    (b) the number of, and interval between, ARP announcements,
        See ANNOUNCE_N and ANNOUNCE_INTERVAL defined in section 2.4

    (c) the maximum rate at which address claiming may be attempted
        See RATE_LIMIT_INTERVAL and MAX_COLLISIONS defined in section 2.2.1

    (d) the time interval between conflicting ARPs below which a host
        MUST reconfigure instead of attempting to defend its address
        See WATCH_WAIT defined in section 2.5

     Personally I slightly prefer A.  If you have an alternative
     proposal, please send text.

Requested Change:

Sec. 3.1 from

    Link-layer technologies that support ARP but operate at rates below 1
    Mbps or latencies above one second may need to specify different

Lengthy Description:

>    In this document, several words are used to signify the requirements
>    of the specification.  These words are often capitalized.

[Stuart]
*Often* capitalized? What does that mean? What does it mean if MUST is
capitalized? What does it mean if it is not capitalized?

[Erik]
This is the standard text which goes out with literally every RFC.

[Stuart]
I disagee.

The draft-07 version *was* the standard text. This is not.

Just reading it, it makes no sense.

It's the wrong paragraph extracted from RFC 2119, out of context, such
that it has no sensible meaning.

[Erik]

RFC 2119 includes the text in the abstract.  A quick skim of
a dozen standards track RFCs show that they do not include the
text you are objecting to, only the legalistic reference to the
reserved upper case words.

Requested Change:

Omit the unnecessary text before "The key words ..."

Was:
1.1.  Requirements

    In this document, several words are used to signify the requirements
    of the specification.  These words are often capitalized.  The key
    words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD",
    "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED",  "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document
    are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

Becomes:
1.1.  Requirements

    The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", i
    "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED",  "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
    document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

Lets be consistent. Can we pick one phrase? Either "outside the scope of
this document" or "left to a future document".

Requested Change:

Use consistent terminology: 'out of scope' in each case.

[Erik]

We seek the unequivocal prevention of IPv4 LL addressses use off-link
not to reduction of the risk of their accidental use off-link.

[Stuart]

You seek unequivocal prevention, but the cautionary measures you advise
don't deliver that.

Therefore, stating that the advised cautionary measures "prevent use of
IPv4 Link-Local addresses in off-link communication" is demonstrably
false. They reduce the risk, but they don't prevent it. Either we need
stronger measures, or a weaker statement. Something needs to be fixed.

The IP address of my printer is 169.254.207.63.

There, I just used a Link-Local address in off-link communication.

Can you propose a software measure that would have unequivocally
prevented me from doing that?

No.

The general containment problem is known to be unsolvable.

There's no reason to have this kind of mistake in the document.

[Erik]

     The problem is the word 'prevent' for you means 'absolutely prevent'
     where others have not found this to be the case.  Merriam Webster
     a) to deprive of power or hoep of acting or succeeding
     b) to keep from happening or existing <steps to prevent war>
     c) to hold or keep back:  HINDER, STOP

    'in order to prevent... the following cautionary measures are advised'
     means 'We advise measures to avoid ...' not 'here is something you can
     do to absolutely  make it impossible for ... to ever occur.'

     I find your suggested wording unacceptable because we are not seeking
     to reduce the likelihood of off-link use.  This implies that in some
     sense off-link use is OK.

    If a host currently has active TCP connections or other reasons
    to prefer to keep the same IPv4 address, and it has not seen any
    other conflicting ARP packets recently (for IEEE 802, within the last
|  WATCH_WAIT seconds) then it MAY elect to attempt to defend its address, by
    recording the time that the conflicting ARP packet was received, and
    then broadcasting one single ARP announcement, giving its own IP and
    hardware addresses as the sender addresses of the ARP.  Having done
    this, the host can then continue to use the address normally without
    any further special action.  However, if this is not the first
    conflicting ARP packet the host has seen, and the time recorded for
    the previous conflicting ARP packet is recent (within WATCH_WAIT
    seconds for IEEE 802) then the host MUST immediately cease using this
    address and configure a new IPv4 Link-Local address as described
    above.  This is necessary to ensure that two hosts do not get stuck
    in an endless loop with both hosts trying to defend the same address.

1.9.  When to configure a Link-Local IPv4 address

    Having addresses of multiple different scopes assigned to an
    interface, with no adequate way to determine in what circumstances
    each address should be used, leads to complexity for applications and
    confusion for users.  A host with an address on a link can
    communicate with all other devices on that link, whether those
    devices use Link-Local addresses, or routable addresses.  For these
    reasons, a host SHOULD NOT have both a valid routable address and a
    Link-Local IPv4 address configured on the same interface.

    A routable address is any address that is:

Is this sentence necessary?

[Erik]

Yes, it is needed.  This response comes from an IESG comment which would
have been a 'discuss' comment and slowed down the progress of the
document.  Further, this changed text was approved in the WG last call
process last month.

[Stuart]

Just for my own benefit, could you please explain what that sentence is
talking about? Why single out wireless? What about powerline? Infrared?
HPNA? IP-over-USB?

[Erik]

    This sentence addresses the concern of an IESG member.  The
     proper time to engage them is during the interval in which they
     are reviewing the document.

     The sentence is harmless, though not very useful.  Including it
     was necessary to get the document approved.

PROBE_MIN and PROBE_MAX suddenly appear, without mention. Can we give
their values FIRST, so the reader has a clue what we're talking about.

[Erik]

This is standard practice in all RFCs that include constants.  We could
add text to section 1.2 if you think that this is confusing to
implementors.

Personally I feel this goes without saying and adding it would only be a
matter of (questionable) style.

[Stuart]

I disagee.

What is the harm in helping the reader understand the document better?

How can unexplained forward references be good style?


Requested Change:

Add to section 1.2

   Constants are introduced in all capital letters.  Their values are
   given in Section 9.

Why "wait for a random time interval selected uniformly in the range
PROBE_MIN to PROBE_MAX"? What's the benefit of enforcing an initial
one-second delay? It just slows things down.

[Erik]

This delay was intended to stop a set of hosts from beginning at the
same time in a 'LAN power up' situation.  This text has passed all
reviews and numerous WG issues to revise and hone it.

[Stuart]

I was not asking about the [0,1] random interval. That's been there since
draft-05.

I was asking about why it is now 1 + [0,1]. What's the extra fixed
one-second delay for? What is achieved by making the process uniformly
take a second longer than it should?

[Erik]

     Hmm.  Reviewing all records, I can't see how this entered the doc.
     I don't have time for archeology to find out when it entered.  I
     don't see why waiting an extra second helps, except to wait for
     network infrastructure to come up (see ll12).

Requested Change:

Text was:

    When ready to begin probing, the host should then wait for a random
    time interval selected uniformly in the range PROBE_MIN to PROBE_MAX
    seconds, and should then send NUM_PROBES probe packets, spaced
    randomly, PROBE_MIN to PROBE_MAX seconds apart.

Text becomes:

    When ready to begin probing, the host should send NUM_PROBES probe
    packets, spaced randomly, PROBE_MIN to PROBE_MAX seconds apart.

Why space probes randomly? I have still not seen any credible
justification for this, neither credible theoretical analysis, nor
experimental data. This text was introduced because of a misunderstanding
of something Christian Huitema said a year ago, and it's been in the
document ever since. An initial random delay is justified. Further
randomness is just voodoo.

[Erik]

This was debated frequently in the WG over the past year and in each
case the delay was kept in the document. If you really believe that the
current text is not reasonable, please contact Christian and see if he
agrees with you.  As I recall, the WG agreed with Christian, who
supported this text and we ended with rough consensus, with you in a
dissenting position. See LL31.

[Stuart]

I disagee.

I asked frequently for credible debate, but never got any, and the
*misplaced randomness* was kept in the document. (My objection here is
not the delay, or even the randomness; it's the pointless inappropriate
misplaced randomness.)

I did ask Christian Huitema repeatedly, in public and in private, if he
was willing to defend this statement that had been attributed to him, but
he never responded to any of the requests.

Is this referring to some Windows bug? It's too vague. We should either
make it concrete enough that the reader understands the specific example
that's being given, or delete it.

[Erik]

This text was very difficult to craft and resulted in 3 successive WG
last call discussions.  Revision of this text, or worse, its removal,
would cause the document to become unacceptable to the DHC WG.

See LL40 especially.

[Stuart]

Okay, I'll be more blunt: This statement is false. It is an outright lie.
Why put known falsehood in the document? If I'm wrong, then please state
which "early implementations of IPv4 Link-Local have modified the DHCP
state machine in an attempt to make IPv4 Link-Local more reliable" and
then I'll be happy with the text.

[Erik]

You don't like the word 'several' in the cited section, is that
the issue?   I have no objects changing the word 'several' to 'at least
one'

It's confusing. People will think: If the application knows the source
address, how can there be a source address selection problem? How about:

    The first scoped address problem is source address selection.

>    If a host has two interfaces on the same network

The host may not *know* they are bridged onto the same link. This is the
real problem that can fool you.

I'd prefer a stronger requirement: If a host has more than one interface
(on the same network or not) then it MUST NOT attempt to confgure the
same LL address on more than one interface.

[Erik]

This is a pretty good technical suggestion, but its about 2 years late.
We have been over this ground many times.  The ultimate journey was
issue LL15.  Since then we have revised the text and moved it around
some - it no longer reads 'distinct for each interface', now its 'run
the algorithm independently for each interface.'

Note that this advice at the end of the first paragraph in section 3.4
would allow the algorithm to detect the conflict and resolve it, albeit
less efficiently than if the host had never created the problem in the
first place.

In issue LL32 we decided we would not attempt to solve problems arising
from use of IPv4 LL when used on more than one interface at a time.  For
this reason, it is inappropriate to include any MUST NOT language in
section 3.

[Stuart]

 From my implementation experience, I can tell you that any implementation
that tries to configure the same address on more than one interface will
run into problems.

A specific example with numbers: If two 100-host networks are joined,
there's still a better than 75% chance that not a single host on either
network will have to select a new address.

[Erik]

There has been no demand in successive reviews for further example.

[Stuart]

I calculated specific numbers to substantiate the previously vague
assertion.

I believe concrete facts are more informative than vagueness.

[Erik]

Thanks for the numbers.  My point is that we need to publish this
document with as few changes as possible.  This is not an editorial
change.  In my opinion 'fact' assertions generate a lot of debate.

Requested Change:

Add to section 1.3

    This specification is intended for use with small ad-hoc networks - a
    single link containing only a few hosts. Although 65024 IPv4 Link-
    Local addresses are available in principle, attempting to use all
    those addresses on a single link would result a high probability of
    an address conflict, requiring a host to take an inordinate amount of
    time to find an available address.

[Erik]

Your sentence means something entirely different than what is in the
document.  In your text host A with LL address a could send 'a' in an
application protocol to host B with a routable address.  In the current
document, this would not be allowed.  We want proper interaction
between hosts A and B with as few restrictions as possible without
disruptive consequences.  That is the fine line we've had to walk for
the past 5 years.  I personally prefer your wording (and its meaning) to
what the document currently says.  To open this up would require us to
go back to discussion, last calls, etc. however.

[Stuart]

As written, other places in the draft allow routable-to-LL communication,
but this "MUST NOT" prohibits that. A routable device can't send packets
to an LL device unless it knows the LL device's LL address, but how can a
routable device learn the LL device's LL address, if sending an LL
address to a non-LL destination address is prohibited?

[Erik]

This is clearly a technical revision we need to consider.  I agree
that we should make this change.

Lengthy Description:

[Stuart]

Also, we need to stress that these are MUST NOT be user-configurable
options, or the users will just decide they can set them to zero to "make
it go faster".

[Erik]

No user configurable options are mentioned in the text.  I do not
understand what you mean by 'set them to zero.'  What settings are you
referring to?

[Stuart]

When you use symbolic identifiers in place of concrete values it implies
abstraction (Generalisation; ignoring or hiding details to capture some
kind of commonality between different instances), which implies therefore
that there are different instances with different values for those
abstracted identifiers.

If the intention is that different instances will have different values
for these symbolic identifiers, then the draft should say so.

If the intention is that different instances will have NOT different
values for these symbolic identifiers, then the draft should say so.

I'm just asking for clarification.

[Erik]

The reasons we are using constants are
     * The WG called for it, primarily
     * There has been an interest in specifying new sets of
       constants 'in the future' for specific link layers which
       might call for different timing
     * Use of constants instead of values in the text is considered
       absolutely necessary by many technical reviewers, for clarity
       and style consistent with other IETF published technical
       documentation.
     * Use of a constant term assures the assignment of the term will
       be in one authoritative place.  This improves the overall
       consistency of the document and improves ease of reference.
       In this respect technical writing parallels acceptable program
       coding practice.

Abstractions are great for experts, but not for people learning. Think
about children. They learn specific examples first, and then from a
collection of specific examples generalize to abstractions. Beginning
with the abstract is not the way to inform the reader.

[Erik]

Listing constants early in the RFC is not common practice.  Constants
are not abstractions.

[Stuart]

Using a symbolic identifier in place of a concrete value is not
abstraction?

Since when?

>[DNAv4]   Aboba, B., "Detection of Network Attachment (DNA) in IPv4",

>           progress), March 2004.

Is this normative or informative?

If ICMP is normative, this should be too.

Or neither should be.

[Erik]

Why do you say that?  The only places we mention DNAv4 is in connection
with DHCPv4.  If the IESG is happy with the informative reference
categorization, so am I.  Adding this to the Normative reference section
would delay publication of IPv4LL till DNAv4 is done.  I do not believe
DNAv4 will complete within a year.

[Stuart]

I disagee.

    For these
    reasons, a host SHOULD NOT have both a valid routable address and an
    IPv4 Link-Local address configured on the same interface.

    A "valid routable address" is a routable address that passes the
    reachability test described in section 2 of "Detection of Network
    Attachment (DNA) in IPv4" [DNAv4].

To implement this "SHOULD NOT" requirement, an implementation has to also
implement [DNAv4] to determine what's a "valid routable address".

Hence, normative reference (or the "SHOULD NOT" prohibition could be
removed or refined to not depend on DNAv4).

[Erik]

Hmmm.  Do you realize you want to raise the bar for the publishing
of this document beyond what the IESG has called for.  This change
of category may well result in tens of months delay of publication of this RFC.

Can we change the 'is' verb in the second cited sentence to one
that reads 'may be determined' and add some text from DNAv4 with
an informative reference 'for further information'?  That is the
way specific citations to 'upcoming work' are usually handled in
order to avoid creating document dependencies.

Requested Change:

Move DNAv4 from informative to normative.

Uh, no. We want to achieve two things: avoid a meltdown in a power
on/off scenario, and space the retransmissions sufficiently to avoid
collisions. However you write it, that means "waiting [0, Probe_max -
Probe_min] for the initial transmission, then NUM_PROBES probe packets,
spaced randomly, PROBE_MIN to PROBE_MAX seconds apart (where Probe_Min
!=3D 0).

The really important part is the initial randomization. It is then
important that each successive trial be space by a sufficient delay. But
it is also important to randomize the second delay to avoid "persistent
bad luck", i.e. the situation where N hosts pick the same initial delay
and then all repeat all of their NUM_PROBE packets at the same time.
Since you need to have a random number generation ready in any case the
implementation overhead is negligible, so why not do the right thing?

Should the initial delay be "0 to PROBE_MAX" seconds?

I think the second randomization is appropriate.

Since utility patents filed before June 7, 1995 are granted for a 
period of 17 years, and since the Apple patents (4,661,902 & 4,689,786) 
were granted on April 28, 1987 and August 25, 1987 respectively, it 
seems to me that one of them has expired and the other will expire 
after August 25th this year. Is this really a problem, since the IESG 
will probably not be ready with the final draft, considering all the 
last minute issues that just came up for consideration?

I guess little guys like me will not be shipping products until 
September.

I agree with the requested change.  Quoting from RFC 2119:

    Authors who follow these guidelines
    should incorporate this phrase near the beginning of their document:

       The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL
       NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED",  "MAY", and
       "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
       RFC 2119.

"Reduce the risk" doesn't seem strong enough to me.

How about:

    To preclude use of IPv4 Link-Local addresses in off-link
    communication, the following cautionary measures are advised:

Is the replacement of "ten" with "WATCH_WAIT" the only proposed change?  If
so, I agree - noting that "WATCH_WAIT" needs to be added to the section
in which constants are defined.

Assuming 169.254.255 is what is replaced, this change is OK with me.

While it's not a big deal, the statement "This is standard practice in all
RFCs that include constants" can be disproven by counterexample; RFC 3315
defines all of the symbolic constants in an early section before any of
those constants are referenced in the specification.

I suggest simply moving section 9 so that it appears before any of the

I agree with Christian; randomizing the successive probes may be
superstition ("voodoo" seems a little harsh), but it also is common practice
and I don't think it hurts to specify it here.

BTW, are we assuming the link layer takes care of collisions or should there
be some explicit provision for retransmitting if one of the probes suffers a
collision?

I agree with the suggested change.  While we're at it, "to whom" ought to be
replaced with "to which".

Well, I notice there's a difference in usage between
draft-ietf-dhc-dna-ipv4-07.txt and draft-ietf-zeroconf-ipv4-linklocal-14.txt:

draft-ietf-dhc-dna-ipv4-07.txt:

2.2.  Reachability Test

    If the host has a valid routable IPv4 address on the "most likely"
    point of attachment, the host will typically perform a reachability
    test, as described in this section.  The purpose of the reachability
    test is to confirm whether the host is connected to a network on
    which it has a valid routable IPv4 address.

draft-ietf-zeroconf-ipv4-linklocal-14.txt:

1.9.  When to configure a Link-Local IPv4 address

    [...]

    A "valid routable address" is a routable address that passes the
    reachability test described in section 2 of "Detection of Network
    Attachment (DNA) in IPv4" [DNAv4].

I read a subtle difference in meaning between these two text snippets: in
draft-ietf-dhc-dna-ipv4-07.txt, a valid routable address need not pass the
reachability test, while in draft-ietf-zeroconf-ipv4-linklocal-14.txt, a
routable address becomes a valid routable address once it has passed the
reachability test.  And, it's not clear draft-ietf-dhc-dna-ipv4-07.txt is
consistent in its use of the phrase "valid routable address".

Now, back to the real problem.  Unfortunately, it appears
draft-ietf-dhc-dna-ipv4-07.txt truly is a normative reference in
draft-ietf-zeroconf-ipv4-linklocal-14.txt as the text currently stands.  An
implementor has to read and understand draft-ietf-dhc-dna-ipv4-07.txt to
implement draft-ietf-zeroconf-ipv4-linklocal-14.txt.

We could try to finesse the problem as Erik suggests, by changing the
reference to the reachability test in draft-ietf-dhc-dna-ipv4-07.txt to be
advisory rather than mandatory.

Another way around the problem would be to copy the text about reachability
testing into draft-ietf-zeroconf-ipv4-linklocal-14.txt.  Seems like a lot of
text to insert that would cause yet another delay, but I don't have a better
suggestion.

I don't think removing the restriction against selecting a link-local
address when a usable routable address is available shold be removed.

I made this point in my December "document review
blast" e-mail.  I'm sorry I didn't make it more
formally.

I believe there should be an initial delay, but it
should be 0..<something> seconds, although that
<something> need not be related to PROBE_MAX.
(It has more to do with the number of "time slots"
you want to allot for participants to randomly
select from.)

The proposed text does NOT include any initial
delay, therefore I do not agree with it.

If the proposal were to have a random initial
delay, with a minimum value zero I would agree
with it.

I made this point as well in December.

I think that an initial random delay is sufficient
to avoid excessive collisions (i.e., to avoid a
storm during a network power-on event).  The subsequent
randomness is unnecessary.

I have no objection to making it clear that
the symbolic values do not imply they are
configurable.

But behind that I don't agree with the statmeent
that a symbol implies an abstraction which implies
configurability.  The benefit of using a symbolic
value is that it can improve clarity, providing
more meaning than (for example) a raw number can.

But I'm sure Stuart isn't the only one that will
interpret this use that way, so I see no problem
with some clarification.

I believe it should have been random initial delay + retransmissions
spaced 1 seconds apart, rather than what somehow came out in the

Can the WG chairs identify, or request Apple to identify, the specific claims 
that alleged to be applicable in each patent?

I am opposed to any Proposed Standard that requires RAND licensing. Apple can 
update it to reflect their proprietary "standard" and release it as an 
Informational RFC if they wish.

I understand the issue but can't comment until the "Requested Change" is

I do not agree with the suggested change.  The sentence is harmless and
satisfies a requirement from the IESG.

Before we get too worried about something that may or may not happen, what
is the history of similar circumstances and how has it played out? (I'd be
surprised if this is the first time this has happened)

[Stuart really...]

  | The host may not *know* they are bridged onto the same link. This is the
  | real problem that can fool you.

Yes, it is, this can be a real difficulty.

  | I'd prefer a stronger requirement: If a host has more than one interface
  | (on the same network or not) then it MUST NOT attempt to confgure the
  | same LL address on more than one interface.

There's no need for that in the protocol.

  |  From my implementation experience, I can tell you that any implementation
  | that tries to configure the same address on more than one interface will
  | run into problems.

It very well might.   But that doesn't mean that it can't be done.
This is up to the implementors to decide.   Nothing requires that
the host use the same address on all interfaces - if an implementor
decides that using a different one on every interface is the easy
way to avoid problems, then that's fine.   But some other implementor
may decide to do it some other way.

The protocol works whichever decision they make, this restriction isn't
needed (and wasn't any of the other of the dozen times this has been
discussed).

Reject this change.

We have been through this before.   Stuart seems to have a fixation
on one (incorrect) rationale for this, and ignores all attempts to
point out the real reason.

Leave this just as it is (ie: I agree with Christian's response).

This is just plain silly.   Nothing suggests that anything is user

any of these numbers, the implementations will make them configurable,
whatever the text says.

No change is needed here.

  | To implement this "SHOULD NOT" requirement, an implementation has to also
  | implement [DNAv4] to determine what's a "valid routable address".
  | 
  | Hence, normative reference (or the "SHOULD NOT" prohibition could be
  | removed or refined to not depend on DNAv4).

I agree with that, it is clearly a normative reference as the text
currently stands.

  | [Erik]
  | 
  | Hmmm.  Do you realize you want to raise the bar for the publishing
  | of this document beyond what the IESG has called for.

Yes, we could cheat, but then if the DNA doc never appears, the LL spec
will be useless.

The best way to fix this is to rewrite the reference so that it is
no longer normative -- the easy way to do that would be to simply
copy the text from the DNA draft that describes what is a valid routable
address, and include it in this doc (and then add an informative
reference to note the source of the text).

Do that we get exactly the meaning the doc currently has, no indefinite
delay waiting for another WG's doc to appear, and no cheating of the
process (with everyone just looking the other way) either.

[Aside: even if the IESG allow this through, because of negligence or
collusion, the RFC editor may spot it, and hold up publication anyway,
so it needs to be fixed, one way or another].

  | Abstractions are great for experts, but not for people learning.

RFCs are for implementors, not for people learning.   Implementors, if
not necessarily experts, should at least be competent.  If someone wants
to publish a book "IPv4 link local addresses for morons" (or whatever)
then they can do it in a way which manes it easy for beginners to
learn the protocol.   The RFC doesn't need to do that.

Reject this (and other similar) change requests (there was at least
one more that was just like this one).

Most of this issue is (or seems to be) editorial, and if someone
checks, and decides that the changes are all editorial (changing "a IP"
to "an IP" clearly is) then I have no problems with most of them.

However, this one, which is mixed in with all that noise ...

  |     seconds for IEEE 802) then the host MUST immediately cease using this
  |     address and configure a new IPv4 Link-Local address as described
  |     above.  This is necessary to ensure that two hosts do not get stuck
  |     in an endless loop with both hosts trying to defend the same address.

if fundamentally wrong.

I know that Stuart believes that the most important issue is to
prevent 2 hosts getting locked up, each refusing to abandon a
duplicated address.    I disagree.   For me, the most important issue
is to prevent the trivial ability of a host to cause my system to
abandon its addresses after which it can take over all my TCP
connections (they're on the same link, by definition using LL addresses,
on many media types, that means the "bad guy" has all the info needed
to pick up my connections, after I have abandoned the address, and
what's more, with nothing to interfere with his continued use of the
connections - my host won't be sending any packets that might get
in the way, which it would if I had retained the address).

By all means, Stuart can make his implementations release addresses as
soon as it sees a conflict (or a 2nd conflict) - I just won't use anything
that absurd on any system I care about.   There's no need for the spec
to prohibit that kind of behaviour.   But the spec must not try and
enforce it.

Leave this text as it is.

Actually, specifically what I'd like is that we just put it back exactly 
how it was in earlier drafts:

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in "Key words for use in

What I suggest is:

1. List the constants, with a brief explanation, and give the value. The 
brief explanation doesn't have to duplicate the full explanation which 
appears later -- just enough to demystify an otherwise opaque name.

2. State the technologies that may use other values.

e.g.

Section 1.3 "Constants"

   The following constants are defined here and referenced later in
   this document.

   START_WAIT           1 second   (initial random delay)
   PROBE_NUM            3          (number of probe packets)
   PROBE_INTERVAL       1 second   (time between probe packets)
   ANNOUNCE_NUM         2          (number of announcement packets)
   ANNOUNCE_INTERVAL    2 seconds  (time between announcement packets)
   RATE_LIMIT_NUM      10          (max collisions before rate limiting)
   RATE_LIMIT_INTERVAL 60 seconds  (delay between successive attempts)
   DEFEND_INTERVAL     10 seconds  (minimum time between defensive ARPs)

   These values are fixed for all implementations conforming to this
   standard. They MUST NOT be end-user configurable options, nor should
   the listing of the values here be taken to imply that each
   implementer is free to substitute other values instead, based on what
   they think will suit each device best. An important part of creating
   interoperable products is being able to depend on predictable
   behaviour from the other products you're interoperating with, and
   having arbitrary variation between different implementations would
   significantly undermine that ability.

   Future standards documents, extending IPv4 Link-Local Addressing to
   media types other than those covered in this document, may specify
   different values for these constants.

Section 1.4 "Applicability"

   ...

   Link-layer technologies that support ARP but operate at rates below 1
   Mbps or latencies above one second may need to specify different
   values for the constants listed in Section 1.3.

Erik, you say that

(a) you want to use the word 'prevent' because you seek
    absolute prohibition on IPv4 LL addresses leaving the link,

and then you say that

(b) the word 'prevent' DOES NOT mean "absolute prohibition";
    it only means something milder, like "hinder".

This is self-contradictory.

To my original point:

When you say, "In order to A you should B," that implies that doing B 
will result in A. In this case, that is untrue, which is why I suggest 
the following:

   Implementers should take every possible precaution to prevent
   IPv4 Link-Local addresses being communicated off the local link.
   To that end, the precautions listed below, and others as appropriate,
   should be followed:

Robert, please re-read the section in question.

It is not talking about addresses used "as addresses", it is talking 
about a prohibition on addresses appearing as data within the IP payload 
of other packets that DO go off-link, such as DNS packets.

The word "use" in this context means "place it in a packet that goes 
off-link".

All I've heard from anyone to defend this is "someone else wanted it".

If no one in this WG can explain what it means, then how is a new reader 
to make sense of it?

The best I can piece together is this:

Russ Housley said "An entry in the list that does not imply an 
infrastructure of any kind is desirable." (Whatever that means.)

The proposed remedy was a double negative: "This example does not imply 
that IPv4LL configuration is inapplicable to wireless interfaces."

Philip Nye wrote, sensibly:

>Personally, I don't think any of these changes are necessary - this 
>clearly appears in an "examples include" section and the next line 
>mentions wireless networking.

The inexplicable parenthetical comment was then added to the document.

That logic seems weak to me.

Thank you Ralph. Hopefully my proposed changes for LL53 address this.

I cannot fathom this point of view.

The first time someone reads any document, including an RFC, they're 
learning what the document says.

What possible reason would we have to NOT make an RFC as clear and 
understandable as possible?

A long time ago, draft-07 said:

   When ready to begin probing, the host should then wait for a
   random time interval selected uniformly in the range zero to two
   seconds, and should then send four probe packets, spaced two
   seconds apart. This initial random delay helps ensure that a
   large number of hosts powered on at the same time do not all send
   their initial probe packets simultaneously.

With our new parametrized text, this becomes:

   When ready to begin probing, the host should then wait for a random
   time interval selected uniformly in the range zero to START_WAIT
   seconds, and should then send PROBE_NUM probe packets, spaced
   PROBE_INTERVAL seconds apart. This initial randomized delay helps
   ensure that a large number of hosts powered on at the same time do
   not all send their initial probe packets simultaneously.

I believe this is perfectly adequate.

Right: The really important part is the initial randomization.

That's been in since draft-05.

There are many problems with adding successive random intervals to this 
-- misconceptions about the nature of "collisions", added implementation 
cost, lower behavioural predictability, which translates into additional 
burdens at layers above and below, but the biggest problem may be this:

The sum of random variables is LESS random than the individual variables.

Ask any statistician, or do a Google search for "central limit theorem" 
or "strong law of large numbers".

Here's a simple example that should be familiar to everyone:

If you throw one die, the numbers 1,2,3,4,5,6 are all equally likely.

If you throw two dice, and add up the results, then 7 is the most likely 
outcome. You are SIX TIMES more likely to get 7 than either 2 or 12.

When you take two uniform (flat) random distributions and add them 
together, you get a distribution that is sharply spiked in the middle. 
Add three or four, and it gets even worse.

A single uniformly distributed random delay, followed by intervals that 
are fixed, not random, avoids this collapse around a central spike:

For n hosts powered on simultaneously that become ready to probe 
simultaneously, the probability that a probe packet will be transmitted 
(by any host) in the first millisecond is n/1000. The probability that a 
probe packet will be transmitted during the second millisecond is also 
n/1000. The probability that a probe packet will be transmitted during 
any given millisecond within the first second is n/1000. The probability 
that a probe packet will be transmitted during any given millisecond 
within the second or third seconds is also n/1000.

The probability density function looks like this:


    p|
     |
     |
     |    ----------------
     |    |              |
     |    |              |
     |    |              |
     |----|----|----|----|----|----|
    -1    0    1    2    3    4    time (seconds)

In terms of minimizing peak demand on the Ethernet switch, or wireless 
spectrum, or whatever resource we are trying to protect, there is no 
better distribution than a completely flat one.

The moment you start summing uniform random distributions, you get a 
pointy distribution with a peak of exaggerated busyness in the middle. If 
we want to avoid overflowing the buffers in the Ethernet switch, a sharp 
burst of traffic is the worst thing to do. A steady uniformly distributed 
stream of traffic with no sudden peaks is what's least likely to cause 
loss.

   A device that implements both IPv4 Link-Local and a DHCPv4 client
   should not alter  the behavior of the DHCPv4 client to accommodate
   IPv4 Link-Local  configuration. In particular configuration of an
   IPv4 Link-Local address,  whether or not a DHCP server is currently
   responding, is not sufficient  reason to unconfigure a valid DHCP
   lease, to stop the DHCP client from  attempting to acquire a new IP
   address, to change DHCP timeouts or to  change the behavior of the
   DHCP state machine in any other way.

   Several early implementations of IPv4 Link-Local have modified the
   DHCP  state machine in an attempt to make IPv4 Link-Local more
   reliable, and the  field experience we have gained from this has
   shown that it does not work  - reliability of DHCP service is
   significantly reduced.   If increased reliability of IPv4 Link-Local
   is desired, we recommend that the IPv4 Link-Local state machine track
   the DHCP client state machine and, in cases where it is not certain
   that the DHCP-assigned address is correct, the  IPv4 Link-Local state
   machine acquire an IPv4 Link-Local address without causing the DHCP
   state machine to relinquish its address.

   Further discussion of this issue is provided in [DNAv4].

My point was this. The document *already* says:

>   If a host has two interfaces on the same network, then claiming and
>   defending on those interfaces must ensure that they end up with
>   different addresses just as if they were on different hosts.

If we say they "must ensure that they end up with different addresses" 
via the usual claiming and defending process, then why not just take the 
next logical step and say they must not try to claim the same address on 
two interfaces in the first place?

Why try something that you know is supposed to fail?

Answering your question, I noticed I had a typo in the email I sent to 
Erik. I meant "better than 85% chance", not 75%.

When we join one network onto another, we can model this as a network 
with 100 hosts on it (the "existing hosts"), and 100 new hosts joining 
that network (the "new hosts"), with the additional constraint that the 
100 new hosts are already known not to conflict with each other.

What is the probability that this entire merge completes without a single 
conflict?

Notation:

p(sn) is the probability that new host n joins without conflict.

p(Sn) is the cumulative probability that n new hosts join without 
conflict.

p(sn|S(n-1)) is the probability that new host n joins without conflict, 
given that the previous hosts all joined without conflict.

p(S100) is the probability that the merge completes without conflict.

By induction

p(Sn) = p(sn|S(n-1)) * p(S(n-1))
[Probability of event Sn is probability of
event sn, given event S(n-1), times probability of event S(n-1)]

so p(S100) = p(s100|S99) * p(S99)

[The probability of complete success (p(S100)) is the probability that 
host 100 will join without conflict, given that the 99 previous ones also 
joined without conflict, times the probability that the 99 previous ones 
also joined without conflict.]

and

p(S0) = 1

[Base case: There can be no conflict when no hosts have joined.]

Therefore, what we want to calculate is the product of

   p(s1|S0) ... p(s100|S99)

What is p(s1|S0)?

The network has 65024 possible addresses. 100 are in use, so 64924 
addresses are available.

New host 1 could have any of the 65024 possible addresses. The 64924 of 
these that are free yield success; the 100 that are in use yield failure. 
p(s1) = 64924/65024 = 99.85% chance of finding a free address.

p(S1) = p(s1|S0) * p(S0) = 0.9985 * 1 = 0.9985.

What is p(s2|S1)?

We now know, given event S1, that the address of new host 1 is not in use 
by another host, on existing or new. That means that there are 65023 
possible other addresses that could be used by existing hosts and by new 
host 2. The probability that new host 2 does not conflict with any 
existing host, given that host 1 did not, is 64923/65023.

In general, 

p(s(n+1)|Sn) = (64924-n)/(65024-n)

For n in the range [0,99], this value ranges from 99.8462% to 99.8460% 
probability of success for each host, and the cumulative product of these 
values is 85.7250% chance of complete success.

C code is below:

#include <stdio.h>

int main(int argc, char **argv)
	{
	double p = 1.0;
	double existinghosts = 100.0;
	double newhosts = 0.0;
	int i;
	
	for (i=1; i<=100; i++)
		{
		double range = (256.0 * 254.0) - newhosts;
		double psuccess = (range - existinghosts) / range;
		p *= psuccess;
		newhosts += 1.0;
		printf("host %3d; newhosts %3.0f; psuccess = %f; p = %f\n",
			i, newhosts, psuccess, p);
		}
	}

The reason for having three probes is to mitigate the effects of 
undetected loss.

Most links like 802.11 and 802.3 have some low-level loss detection to 
mask some (but not all) losses.

If the link could guarantee to report or recover from *all* losses, there 
wouldn't be any undetected loss, so one probe would be enough.

Stuart,

This is a completely spurious statistical argument I'm afraid. If you =
want to use the dice example - here is the scenario:

You an I both generate a series of 4 numbers. The first value is =
generated by throwing a single die.

case A. Each subsequent value is generated by adding 4, 3 and 4 =
respectively to the preceeding value.

case B. Each subsequent value is generated by throwing the die again and =
adding that value to the preceeding value.

Now the probability that you are talking about is that you and I agree =
on AT LEAST ONE value in our series which does increase in case B. It is =
1/6 for A and approximately 0.52 for B.

However that is irrelevant, the chance we need to avoid is that you and =
I both agree on ALL FOUR values in our series. For A this probability is =
1/6 while for B it is 1/(6^4) =3D 1/1296.

Returning to the computer algorithm, given the fact that in many =
implementations a "random" delay is likely to be quantised to the =
inherent tick frequency of the operating system, then the probability of =
an initial delay in the range 0..1 second being the same for two hosts =
is not very low (1/100 for a typical OS and as big as 1/20 for some). =
Making subsequent delays also random drastically increases the chances =
that at least some of the probes will not clash.

What is the reason for sending four probes? In the case of only the =
initial delay being randomised, the extra ones merely guard against the =
possibility that probes may be dropped or lost. In the case of =
consecutive random delays this still applies but they have the added =
benefit of reducing the chances of all probes being lost because of =
timing clashes.

In conclusion. I agree with Christian that the initial wait should be in =
the range 0..(PROBE_MAX - PROBE_MIN) which is different from the current =
draft. I also agree with him that the subsequent delays should be =
randomised exactly as in the current draft.

Philip

As I suggested earlier, we should follow the recommendation of RFC 2119:

    Authors who follow these guidelines
    should incorporate this phrase near the beginning of their document:

       The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL
       NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED",  "MAY", and
       "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
       RFC 2119.

We only say they must end up with different addresses "If a host has two =
interfaces on the same network".

We also suggest that the best thing is to run the algorithm =
independently on each interface and if this is done then the requirement =
will be met as a consequence of defending one interface against the =
other and the algorithm need not be explicitly aware of whether they are =
on a common network or not.

The document talks about the difficulty of trying to run zeroconf on =
multiple interfaces and in some systems avoiding the same address on =
multiple interfaces may help reduce the problems - but does not resolve =
them all. However, in other systems (e.g. where the interface to use is =
explicitly specified - by some other means than by IP address) then =
there is not necessarily any problem with using the same address =
provided those interfaces are on separate networks. Fully independent =
running of the algorithm may occasionally end up this way without the =
system ever noticing.

I do not support the proposed change. We should stick to the existing =
text - maybe change "must" to "MUST"

We have the recommended text verbatim from RFC2119.

We also have two introductory sentences: "In this document, several =
words are used to signify the requirements of the specification. These =
words are often capitalized."

The two extra sentences are also lifted directly from RFC2119 and as =
such it is hard to argue against them. They may be redundant, but they =
are not harmful and it should be too late to change them.

I support Erik's analysis.

The special case of having a routable address but only a locally =
resolvable name and particularly if there is some knowledge that the =
name will not be used off-link is sufficient justification for an =
implementer to reject the "SHOULD" and is why this is not "MUST".

Finally, I don't think this is a deal breaker and it should be too late =
to make a change.

I have no objection to the suggestion to move
the parameters definition to the front of the
document.

Even if it is left in section 9, I think Stuart
has done a fine job with his proposed text.  It
addresses all of my original concerns about
parameterization and probing intervals.

One minor exception, I think the sentence that
begins, "An important part of creating interoperable
products..." is a bit preachy.

[philip]
The change is probably better. I believe this is more than an editorial =
change since it decouples ANNOUNCE_INTERVAL from PROBE_MAX.

[philip]
I see no need for the change.

However, if we are to parameterize WATCH_WAIT as proposed we should do =
it properly. The text should read:

"...and it has not seen any other conflicting ARP packets within =
WATCH_WAIT seconds then it MAY elect..."

and in section 9:
WATCH_WAIT    10 seconds for IEEE802

[philip]
Agree changing "answer" to "question".
Neutral on adding "on" - it is a very pedantic change.

[philip]
It's way too late to make trivial changes like this - there is no =

Stuart is right that there is an issue and in fact the definition of 1.9 =
is better than that of 1.2.

I agree with the proposed change and the additional modification in =
Stuarts subsequent email:

Replace

   This document uses the term "routable address" to refer to all
   unicast IPv4 addresses outside the 169.254/16 prefix, including
   global addresses and private addresses such as Net 10/8 [RFC1918],
   all of which may be forwarded via routers.

with

   This document uses the term "routable address" to refer to all valid
   unicast IPv4 addresses outside the 169.254/16 prefix that may be
   forwarded via routers. This includes all global IP addresses and
   private addresses such as Net 10/8 [RFC1918], but not loopback
   addresses such as 127.0.0.1

I agree with Stuart that this text is unnecessary and the more I read it =
the less it means.

However, I also agree with Erik and Ralph that this text has already =
delayed the document, that it does no harm and that it has been through =
last call so the chance to argue it has passed.

Agree in principle but suggested text change is wrong.

text should read:

    When ready to begin probing, the host should then wait for a random
    time interval selected uniformly in the range 0 to (PROBE_MAX - =
PROBE_MIN)
    seconds, and should then send NUM_PROBES probe packets, spaced
    randomly, PROBE_MIN to PROBE_MAX seconds apart.

Alternatively use PROBE_MIN and PROBE_RANGE:

    When ready to begin probing, the host should then wait for a random
    time interval selected uniformly in the range 0 to PROBE_RANGE
    seconds, and should then send NUM_PROBES probe packets, spaced
    randomly, PROBE_MIN to (PROBE_MIN + PROBE_RANGE) seconds apart.

This is omitting a specific recommendation as well as the unspecified =
example you objected to.

Whether just one or more implementations have made the mistake is =
irrelevant - it has been established as a mistake and useful guidance is =
provided.

However, this reads to me like a worry that unspecified "bad" former =
implementations may become erroneously associated with particular =
companies.

If this is the case, I could accept changing the first part of the =
offending paragraph:

   Several early implementations of IPv4 Link-Local have modified the
   DHCP  state machine in an attempt to make IPv4 Link-Local more
   reliable, and the  field experience we have gained from this has
   shown that it does not work  - reliability of DHCP service is
   significantly reduced.

To:

   Field experience has shown that modifying the DHCP state machine
   in an attempt to make IPv4 Link-Local more reliable does not work
   - reliability of DHCP service is significantly reduced.

I prefer the text as it stands. Using "source address" reminds the =
reader of why we know the address of the sender - because it came as the =
source address in the incoming message.

I do not support the proposed change.

I am quite happy with the current text. The use of protocol constants in =
the way we have done is commonplace and this is a protocol =
specification, not a guide for dummies.

I agree that as it stands the reference is normative.

We could get around this by making the definition more vague:

Change:
   A "valid routable address" is a routable address that passes the
   reachability test described in section 2 of "Detection of Network
   Attachment (DNA) in IPv4" [DNAv4].

to:
   "valid routable address": The determination of whether a routable
   address is valid will vary with the network infrastructure and
   system context. A useful guide is provided by the reachability
   test described in section 2 of "Detection of Network
   Attachment (DNA) in IPv4" [DNAv4] which is performed by attempting
   to verify reachability of the default gateway(s).

Would it not then behoove us to eliminate ambiguity wherever possible? Ego
about "this is not a guide for dummies" set aside, ambiguity about standards
has cause problems before. For an example, see "The Great Microsoft Kerberos
Scandal."

Clarity is always preferable to ambiguity.

I support this. Regardless of how other RFCs do this, it is far more
sensible to define constants and other RFC specific terms prior to their
use. Again, this is not catering to the lowest common denominator, but
rather giving the people who will use this RFC more clarity in the terms
used by the RFC.

I support this. The fact that they are capitalized as they are listed is a
clear sign that this is a common case usage. Telling people they are often
capitalized is redundant, especially with the reference to 2119.

Agreed. "Out of scope" implies that however this is settled, it won't be
here. "In a future document" implies that it may be settled in a future rev
of this document, in a future rev of some other document, some document that
is being built, or in some document that does not yet exist, and may never
exist.

"Out of scope" is simpler, and more clear.

If it's the only way to get it approved, fine, but it's useless verbiage,

I will say that at least in American English, suddenly using undefined terms
will get you fussed at by almost anyone.

Using terms without defining them first is a great way to cause problems.
Since this is an engineering document of sorts, document - specific terms
should be properly defined as to their usage in the document prior to that
usage.

If we can't see how it got in, it should be taken out.

I support this. It's far better practice to define terms prior to use.

Stuart is right that the sum of randomness
leads to less randomness.  However Philip is
right that it doesn't really apply here, since
by definition we're dealing with a case in which
a probe resulted in a collision (i.e., two hosts
picked the same initial delay).

My contention has been that the initial random
delay is sufficient to address this collision
issue, provided the range of that delay is big
enough that the number of quantized "slots"
therein is adequate.  Going back to the dice
example, it's rolling a 12-sided die once
instead of a 6-sided die twice.

(Also, again, the purpose of this delay is
different from the purpose of the probe interval,
so should be defined independent from PROBE_MIN
and PROBE_MAX.)

My only comment on this is that the paragraph that would
follow this one in the document should be updated as well,
to indicate something like:

   If during this period, from the beginning of the probing process
   until PROBE_INTERVAL seconds after the last probe packet is sent, the =
host
   receives any ARP packet

(It previously used "PROBE_MAX" rather than "PROBE_INTERVAL".)

Also, a few paragraphs later:

   If, by PROBE_INTERVAL seconds after the transmission of the last ARP =
probe
   no conflicting ARP Reply or ARP probe has been received, then the
   host has successfully claimed the desired Link-Local IPv4 address.

(I haven't done any exhaustive review of the document for this
so there could be other spots.)

I agree with Philip's reasoning - the subsequent randomization addresses the
(admittedly small, assuming good random number generators) problem that two
hosts might pick an initial delay within a collision window of each other.
If there is no randomization of subsequent probes, there is no point in
specifying multiple probes.

This is statement is asserted without any supporting evidence, and it is 
false.

This is NOT what we need to avoid.

In order to be a good network citizen, we want to minimize the aggregate 
peak load that a large number of hosts may impose on network 
infrastructure, since peak load is what causes loss. This issue only 
arises when there are a large number of hosts probing simultaneously. Two 
hosts, or three, or four or even ten host probing at *exactly* the same 
time is NOT a problem.

The Ethernet collision loss myth has existed for decades. University 
computer science lecturers teach students that it's a myth, but still the 
myth persists in the larger population.

Collisions do not cause loss on Ethernet. They did not on thick coax, 
thin coax, or on UTP.

Pay particular attention to the second paragraph below.

No, this is false.

We don't assume the ARP probes are the ONLY traffic on the network.

The reason for trying three times is that there may be OTHER brief bursts 
of traffic on the link that overflow the switch buffers (or cause CSMA/CD 
breakdown, etc.) resulting in one or more probes being lost.

In reality, the amount of traffic generated by ARP probing is too low by 
itself to cause switch buffer overflow -- PROVIDING that it is 
distributed over several seconds. Should all the probes be sent in a 
tight bunch, then the chance of switch buffer overflow could become 
non-zero, which is why the initial random delay is useful to eliminate 
that.

>several appear to be pedantic filibusters!

These are not filibusters, pedantic or otherwise.

The authors of the document are entitled -- required even -- to exercise 
sound judgment about typographical issues in the document. Questions of 
spelling errors, simple grammatical errors, etc., trivial mistakes (e.g. 
"169.254.255" where it should have said "169.254.255.255") can and should 
be fixed without a lot of protracted debate.

In the interest of transparency Erik Guttman chose to list even all these 
minor changes for the benefit of the working group.

The filibuster here, if any, is the attitude, "There's nothing wrong with 
this edit and it would improve the document, but I'm going to oppose it 
anyway."

If we want this process to conclude, we need to sincerely work towards 
agreement. If we seek every opportunity for disagreement, the process 
could continue indefinitely.

Lets please try to find agreement here. If you find factual or technical 
errors in the proposed edits then by all means point them out, otherwise, 
lets just agree and publish the document.

I have no objection to giving our best known advice:

My objection is to inventing fictitious "early implementations" or "field 
experience" to apparently back up our advice.

This is strangely topical -- the US president and the US and UK 
governments are taking a lot of criticism right now for the alleged 
fabrication of supporting evidence to justify their chosen course of 
action.

What is this claimed "field experience"? Is it a pure fiction?

  | The word "use" in this context means "place it in a packet that goes

Yes, but it has to be there as an address, in a context where using
it as an address would make sense.   Beyond that the restriction would
be absurd - it would prohibit particular bit patterns in jpeg files
(or compressed data) for example...

Anyone reading this who can't work that out for themselves is beyond hope.

  | What possible reason would we have to NOT make an RFC as clear and 
  | understandable as possible?

None.   And if you had raised some of you points when the doc was
being debated, I'd be agreeing with more of them - even if it had been
done during the last call.   But that isn't what happened.   Now it
just looks like an attempt to delay a doc that you don't really like for
as long as possible in the hopes that it will end up being so late as
to be useless.   Much better to publish what we have now.  If necessary
after experience with it, a clearer doc can be made part of advancing
this from PS to DS (or whatever the standards process migrates into,
assuming that it may eventually alter).

That said, I actually don't agree that putting const definitions at the
front makes the text easier to understand.   For me, it makes it harder.
When I see a bunch of definitions like that, I immediately find myself
jumping to conclusions about how they're going to be used, and inventing
my own imaginary protocol to use the things as I have dreamed them.
That then makes actually understanding what is written harder, as I'm
constantly prejudiced by my earlier imaginings about how the whole thing
is going to work.

So, even if there was some desire to make things better, and some text
was going to be changed, the very most I'd want would be a forward
reference in the introduction - something along the lines of "Symbolic
constants will be used throughout this document, to determine the
values of those constants, refer to section 9".

And then, when I read the doc, initially (not actually doing an
implementation) I avoid looking forward at the values, as 99% of the
time, knowing the actual numbers helps with nothing (short of
implementing it).

But at this stage in the processing of this doc, I don't want even that.

  | Collisions do not cause loss on Ethernet. They did not on thick coax, 
  | thin coax, or on UTP.

Of course they don't - that was never the issue, once again, you're
raising and dismissing a strawman.

The problem is packet arrival and the ability of *every* host on the
LAN to handle a packet train of length N - every host because they're
all broadcast packets.   And the same train in the same order every time.

Typically there's at least one host on a LAN that has a fairly small
threshold for N, before packets are dropped - and usually the same
packets every time.    If that host just happens to be the one that
has the same address as the one being probed by the packet that is
lost (on reception, not on the wire) every time, then the protocol
fails.

As Christian said, the implementation already has some kind of RNG
(or PRNG), it has to to calculate the first random interval.  Thus
there's essentially no cost in using it every time (a few extra
calculations, a multiply & modulus usually).   There's a clear benefit,
you don't get the same packet train every time, different packets
get lost each retransmit.    That allows the protocol to work.

Get off this hobby horse, fine a better one.

Somehow, you seem to have missed the process steps where we already

I don't mind fixing the bad grammar, and obvious typos, but would have

More than that is just too late now.

Stuart makes the point that throwing dices several times in sequence
makes the sum more predictable. That is however not entirely true. The
law of big numbers predicts that the standard deviation of the average
is inversely proportional to the square root of the number of trials.
However, we are not concerned here with the value of the average, but
rather with the value of the sum. According to the law of big numbers,
the standard deviation of the sum does not decrease: it increases
proportionally to the square root of the number of trials.=20

In the case of N trials between 0 and 1 (first trial) or between 0.5 and
1.5 (successive trials) the average total delay will be 0.5*(N-1)+0.5*N
=3D (N-1)+0.5; the average variance of this total delay will be N/4; the
standard deviation of the last trial will be sqrt(N)/2.

In the case of N trials where the first one is randomized between 0 and
1 and the later ones repeated 1 second after the 1st one, the average
total delay will be 0.5 + (N-1); the average variance of the delay will
be 1/4; the standard deviation will be 1/2.

That is, a sum of multiple random picks does indeed result in more
randomization than a single random pick.=20

I quite thought Ethernet collisions were a thing of the past! it =
certainly never occurred to me that they would give rise to higher layer =
packet loss - what has this to do with IPv4LL?

Large numbers of packets arriving simultaneously - or just a few in some =
of the lightweight devices likely to use IPv4LL - can and does cause =
packets to be dropped. If the same sequence of packets arrives each time =
then the same ones are likely to be dropped each time.

Stuart - can you explain which "collision myth" is referred to in the second
paragraph.  I think there are several.

And, of course, you're right about my statement concerning multiple probes
and randomization.  The randomization of subsequent probes desynchronizes
just the probe traffic...

I agree with Philip - and the concrete example can easily lead to
interminable debate about the assumptions and details of the computation.  I
do not support making this change.

I apologise for any offence but having got the document through last =

found it rather frustrating to be called back to debate the merits of =
calling a section "Unintentional Autoimmune Response" rather than =
"Unintentional Autoimmunity".

It is quite correct to point out typographic mistakes such as the =
"169.254.255" example you spotted. However, it is insulting to the group =
on this list who have patiently debated through this document over =
months and months and after the process is closed to attempt to reopen =
debate over whether a different way to express something is "better" =
than the way which has been agreed. There was a time for this and many =
issues were debated to the satisfaction of all - that time has gone.

There will always be scope in a document of this complexity to improve =
readability or clarity - at least for some readers - but the test at =
this point should not be "does this make it clearer?" but "is the =
existing text wrong, imprecise or sufficiently confusing that a person =
with reasonable experience of implementing protocols from specifications =
will get it wrong". In my experience the current draft is more clear and =
readable than a number of protocol specs I have had to follow.

I had taken it on good faith in the original authors that it was the =

I joined in. My experience with some Windows implementations certainly =

So Stuart which side are you on? - are you with Dubya or are you with =

Christian, we can answer this very simply. I gave a little picture 
showing the probability density function for the simple scheme as we had 
it two years ago:


    p|
     |
     |
     |    ----------------
     |    |              |
     |    |              |
     |    |              |
     |----|----|----|----|----|----|
    -1    0    1    2    3    4    time (seconds)


Can you send us a little picture showing the probability density function 
for the scheme you're proposing?

It has to be:
(a) wider (takes longer to complete), or
(b) taller (peak traffic burst is higher), or
(c) both

Which is it?

The unstated unconscious assumption in so much of the discussion on this 
mailing list that, if two machines send packets at the same time, then 
inevitably one or both get lost.

If you re-read past discussion you'll see that it's never stated, but 
almost always assumed. To pick one recent example:

>the chance we need to avoid is that
>you and I both agree on ALL FOUR values in our series

Why do we "need" to avoid this?

The assumption behind that statement, and so many like it, is that it 
would be a catastrophe if two machines were to send at the same time, and 
consequently the protocol needs extra mechanisms to avoid this 
catastrophe. This assumption is felt to be so self-evident that it is 
never stated explicitly, just assumed as a universally accepted axiom.

The fact is that spreading the first packet uniformly over a one-second 
interval offers a dramatic benefit by eliminating a potentially large 
synchronized burst. The faulty logic is to conclude from this, "If some 
randomness is good, then more randomness must be better, right?"

Complete nonsense. Of course it doesn't fail. All this posturing ignores 
the fact that WE'VE BEEN SHIPPING PRODUCTS FOR SIX YEARS. This claimed 
failure is pure invention. In the vanishingly unlikely event of repeating 
identical packet loss, the conflict is subsequently detected and resolved 
a few seconds later when subsequent ARP packets are sent, and the hosts 
then pick new addresses and immediately re-probe.

The real point is that increased randomness buys us nothing worthwhile, 
and has a cost, in the form of increased variability in total address 
acquisition time, which which impacts the layers below and above:

Below: When a switch vendor asks, "How quickly do I have to bring port on 
line to be sure I don't miss all the ARP probes?" that answer becomes 
*shorter* than it would otherwise be. This tighter constraint may make 
the switch design harder.

Above: When an application writer asks, "How long should I expect address 
acquisition to take, before concluding that there may be some unusual 
error condition?" that answer becomes *longer* than it would otherwise 
be. This longer timeout results in degraded user experience.

These costs are paid by *every* host using IPv4LL, *every* time it has to 
acquire an address.

And for what?

To protect against an event that never happens, and wouldn't really 
matter even if it did.

There's a famous old quote from Antoine de Saint-Exupery which applies to 
protocol design:

<http://dictionary.reference.com/search?q=elegant>

>A designer knows he has achieved perfection not when there is
>nothing left to add, but when there is nothing left to take away.

I'm not trying to propose any radical new things here. I thought draft-07 
was pretty good. My concerns are all the weird stuff that's appeared 
since then that no one can really justify, except with answers like, "I 
think someone else wanted it."

It was never in the early drafts.

It seems to have appeared in draft-11, in January this year.

Please remember that I've been doing as long as anyone.

I did the Mac OS 8.5 implementation, back in 1998, and I co-chaired the 
first NITS bof in 1999.

If you're tired of this, think how I feel.

At the end of the day, this is something I've been working on for six 
years now. That's a long time for a document that can basically be summed 
up as, "Pick an address and ARP to see if someone else is already using 
it."

What I'd like to avoid is a Bay-of-Pigs type situation where someone 
points to a sentence or paragraph in the document and says, "What does 
that mean?" and none of us knows the answer.

LL46 is a good example.

The WG chair announced, "1 week to discuss [LL46]".

If I understand correctly, the scheme that you describe here assumes an
initial spacing over 1 second, followed by two repetitions spaced one
second apart. You measure the probability that a packet be sent on any
given second. Since in your scheme each second is a perfect repeat of
the previous one, the scheme is indeed flat. However, having each second
be a perfect repeat of the previous one is not a very desirable
characteristic.

The scheme that I described would indeed have a different curve -- just
as wide, but taller. It will however minimize the probability of
collisions.

If you do want a scheme that is also flat but random, then you can do
the following:

	Wait R1 =3D random(0..1) before the 1st try;
	Wait R2 =3D 1+random(0..1)-R1 before the second try;
	Wait R3 =3D 2+random(0..1)-R2 before the third try.

It produces the same flat distribution that you find desirable, without
the correlation between the consecutive intervals.

Whatever you might have thought about draft-07, that isn't the one that
went through IETF last call, and was approved by the IETF.   You might have
liked it, but clearly lots of other people didn't.    07 was a LONG time
ago now.   There has been lots of debate over lots of these issues in the
intervening period - much of whioch you participated in.   Some of those
ended in outcomes that you obviously don't agree with.    Live with it.

The "I think..." is an incorrect summary of what was said about one
particular issue, which was really "requested by the IESG".  That
text was basically noise as best I could tell, we could delete it, then
the IESG would just say to put it in again.   If your objective is to
delay this doc forever, going round and round that circle would certainly
do it.   Most of us would prefer to have the thing published, and if the
price of that is to include one meaningless noise sentence, to pacify
some part of the IESG, then I think we can survive - that's much less
that some other WG's have to do to get some docs past the IESG approval
process.

You are correct here - sorry.

You questioned the truth of the assertion in clause 2.11 that "early =
implementations of IPv4 link-local have modified the DHCP  state =
machine...". The answer is in the document already  - the latest draft =
states in appendix A.3:

   "When in INIT state, the Windows 98/98SE DHCP Client sends out a
   total of 4 DHCPDISCOVERs, with an inter-packet interval of 6
   seconds.  When no response is received after all 4 packets (24
   seconds), it will autoconfigure an address."

Windows at this point abandons its DHCP address whether or not it has a =
valid lease. This is one of the things which Clause 2.11 is specifically =
warning against and is a modifcation of the DHCP state machine to =
accomodate IPv4LL autoconfiguration.

The details for the Mac OS 8 and 9 also suggest that no attempt is made =
to use a valid existing lease if a DHCP server is not found - favouring =
IPv4LL.

I stand by my comment then and later. The extra phrase was added at the =
request of the IESG. We could have pointed out to the person concerned =
that the very next example mentioned wireless networks and asked whether =
they thought their text was still necessary. For all I know this was =
done? We could have spent an extra week or two (or three or four) =
batting it around to get a better form of words, but in fact the meaning =
of the text in question is clear enough and is not wrong. It does not =
affect the protocol in any way - it is merely redundant in the opinion =
of some (myself included). In these circumstances I was happy to see it =
go through in the interests of closure - given that somebody else =
thought it important.

My frustration now is not with your argument over this text, it is with =
your timing - LL46 was discussed and you had as much opportunity to =
argue the point then as anyone else. The issue was closed and should not =
be reopened unless the text is incorrect or likely to cause erroneous =
implementations. This test definitely applies to some of the issues =
which you have recently raised and I have supported them.

Stuart,

You left out the context of LL46.

1) I presented the IESG concerns to the WG for discussion
2) We worked with the IESG members and had an opportunity to dissent
3) We closed the discussion

What is important in an IETF working group effort is to achieve at
least a rough consensus in a timely manner.  The process has been
open, fair and must be binding.

I am sure that if you had raised the point regarding the utility of the
text in March, you could have worked something out with Russ.  The point
is, it is now too late for this unless you have strong support from the
WG.

We will make any changes needed to correct errors in the document that
would prevent it from serving its intended purpose.  *All* changes at
this point must be passed with a strong WG consensus.  The existing
document with the agreed upon changes will be what is provided to the
IESG as the WG's recommendation to publish as an RFC.  If you feel that
this process has not been correct according to the IETF procedures and
policies you may of course appeal the output of the WG. 

Erik

The two most important changes in my mind are LL61 and LL67.
These call for changes to the protocol to correct errors which
entered the specification due to the change process.

We have broad agreement so far that LL61 should be accepted,
but only Philip Nye, myself and Stuart supporting LL67.  Please
take a good look at these issues and respond in the next week.

Best regards and thanks for your assistance,

Erik

I don't think the new text correctly captures either of the behaviors we've 
discussed - I don't see where an initial delay is specified.

I think this text is correct:

    When ready to begin probing, the host should then wait for a random
    time interval selected uniformly in the range 0 to INITIAL_DELAY
    seconds, and should then send NUM_PROBES probe packets, spaced
    randomly, PROBE_MIN to PROBE_MAX seconds apart.

where INITIAL_DELAY is defined somewhere to be 1.

Assuming the random delays stand, this wording
is good.

Agree with Ralph's suggested text:

"
      The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL
      NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED",  "MAY", and
      "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in

I agree with the proposed change as well as the terminology change
proposed by Stuart:

Replace

   This document uses the term "routable address" to refer to all
   unicast IPv4 addresses outside the 169.254/16 prefix, including
   global addresses and private addresses such as Net 10/8 [RFC1918],
   all of which may be forwarded via routers.

with

   This document uses the term "routable address" to refer to all valid
   unicast IPv4 addresses outside the 169.254/16 prefix that may be
   forwarded via routers. This includes all global IP addresses and
   private addresses such as Net 10/8 [RFC1918], but not loopback
   addresses such as 127.0.0.1

Agree with deleting the sentence.  IEEE 802 technology includes wireless
technologies such as 802.11, 802.15, 802.16, etc. so that the IESG
concern is unfounded.

I disagree with this change.  There is no place that Section 9 could be
moved within Section 1 that would not result in renumbering of the rest
of Section 1.  This would require changing references within the document
which could introduce errors, requiring yet more changes and review.

Given how far we are at this point, this kind of change is inappropriate.

It is true that the additional paragraph doesn't make much sense:

"  Several early implementations of IPv4 Link-Local have modified the
   DHCP  state machine in an attempt to make IPv4 Link-Local more
   reliable, and the  field experience we have gained from this has
   shown that it does not work  - reliability of DHCP service is
   significantly reduced.   If increased reliability of IPv4 Link-Local
   is desired, we recommend that the IPv4 Link-Local state machine track
   the DHCP client state machine and, in cases where it is not certain
   that the DHCP-assigned address is correct, the  IPv4 Link-Local state
   machine acquire an IPv4 Link-Local address without causing the DHCP
   state machine to relinquish its address."

Appendix A provides several examples of behavior that is not conformant
with RFC 2131 in *both* MacOS and Windows.  So saying that the DHCP state
machine was modified is correct, although it seems somewhat odd
to attribute this to an "attempt to make IPv4 Link-Local more reliable";
more likely it came out of a desire to reduce address assignment delays.

Advising that the IPv4 Link-Local state machine track the DHCP state
machine seems strange at best.  It does make sense to assign an IPv4
Link-Local address early on (which addresses the assignment time issue),
but there is more to this than is described here, so it's best to leave it
out.

Here is a proposed fix:

"As documented in Appendix A, early implementations of IPv4 Link-Local
have modified the DHCP state machine.  Field experience shows that
these modifications reduce the reliability of the DHCP service.

A device that implements both IPv4 Link-Local and a DHCPv4 client
should not alter the behavior of the DHCPv4 client to accommodate
IPv4 Link-Local configuration. In particular configuration of an
IPv4 Link-Local address, whether or not a DHCP server is currently
responding, is not sufficient reason to unconfigure a valid DHCP
lease, to stop the DHCP client from attempting to acquire a new IP
address, to change DHCP timeouts or to change the behavior of the
DHCP state machine in any other way.

Further discussion of this issue is provided in [DNAv4]."

-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Examples of non-conformance to RFC 2131:

A.1:

"   Mac OS sends nine DHCPDISCOVER packets, with an interval of two
   seconds between packets. If no response is received from any of these
   requests (18 seconds), it will autoconfigure."

"   Autoconfigured Mac OS systems check for the presence of a DHCP server
   every five minutes. If a DHCP server is found but Mac OS is not
   successful in obtaining a new lease, it keeps the existing
   autoconfigured IP address. "

A.2:

"DHCP sends two packets, with timeouts of one and
   two seconds.  If no response is received (three seconds), it begins
   autoconfiguration.  DHCP continues sending packets in parallel for a
   total time of 60 seconds."

"   If DHCP is not successful, it waits five minutes before starting over
   again.  "

A.3:

"   When in INIT state, the Windows 98/98SE DHCP Client sends out a total
   of 4 DHCPDISCOVERs, with an inter-packet interval of 6 seconds.  When
   no response is received after all 4 packets (24 seconds), it will
   autoconfigure an address."

"   Autoconfigured Windows 98/98SE systems check for the presence of a
   DHCP server every five minutes."

I do not believe that [DNAv4] should be a normative reference.

However, the text in question does seem to mandate the DNAv4 reachability
test:

"   For these
   reasons, a host SHOULD NOT have both a valid routable address and an
   IPv4 Link-Local address configured on the same interface.

   A "valid routable address" is a routable address that passes the
   reachability test described in section 2 of "Detection of Network
   Attachment (DNA) in IPv4" [DNAv4]."

In this text, it does not seem to me to make any difference whether the
routable address has passed a reachability test or not.  For example,
would it be ok for the host to have a routable address and an IPv4
Link-Local address configured on the same interface if the routable
address did *not* pass the reachability test?

Since that doesn't make sense either, the use of the term "valid" (and
it's definition, which by the way is not the same as in [DNAv4]) is not
required.

Suggest this be changed to:

"For these reasons, a host SHOULD NOT have both a routable address and an
IPv4 Link-Local address configured on the same interface."

Keep the [DNAv4] reference informative.

I don't support the proposed change.  Running claim and defend

Subject: LL70: Use of the term "valid"

MIME-Version: 1.0

In looking over Issue LL70, I've come to the conclusion that the term
"valid" is used gratuitously in several places, and that in several
cases the term can be removed without doing damage.  If this is done,
I think that a normative reference to [DNAv4] will not be required.

Section 1.9:

"For these reasons, a host SHOULD NOT have both a valid routable address and a
Link-Local IPv4 address configured on the same interface."

I don't think the term "valid" is useful here.  If the routable address is
invalid then it should not be configured.  The term can be deleted
without changing the meaning.

"   A "valid routable address" is a routable address that passes the
   reachability test described in section 2 of "Detection of Network
   Attachment (DNA) in IPv4" [DNAv4]."

This definition belongs in the terminology section, not here and in any
case it differs from the definition used in [DNAv4].  Recommend adding the
following definition to Section 1.2:

"A "valid routable address" is a routable address which is either
statically assigned or whose lease
has not expired and that passes the
reachability test described in section 2 of "Detection of Network
Attachment (DNA) in IPv4" [DNAv4]."

"   When an interface has a valid routable address configured on an
   interface, the host SHOULD NOT also assign a Link-Local IPv4 address
   to that interface."

Again, the term "valid" is not helpful.  A host shouldn't have an invalid
address assigned on an interface, so the term "valid" has no use here
either.

"   If a host finds that an interface that was previous configured with a
   Link-Local IPv4 address is now configured with a valid routable
   address, the host MUST always use the routable address when
   initiating new communications, and MUST cease advertising the
   availability of the Link-Local IPv4 address through whatever
   mechanisms that address had been made known to others."

Again, the term "valid" is not needed here -- if the host has a routable
address configured, that's enough.

"Ways in which a valid routable address might be configured
   for the interface include:

   * Manual configuration
   * Address assignment through DHCP
   * Roaming of the host to a network on which a routable address
      assigned to the interface is valid

   If a host finds that an interface that was previously configured with
   a valid routable address no longer has a valid routable address, the
   host MAY identify a usable Link-Local IPv4 address (as described in
   section 2) and assign that address to the interface.  Ways in which a
   valid routable address might no longer be assigned to an interface
   include:

   * Removal of the address from the interface through manual
      configuration
   * Expiration of the lease on the address assigned through DHCP
   * Roaming of the host to a new network on which the address is no
     longer valid."

Here several uses of the term "valid" are not helpful.  Recommend changing
to:

"  Ways in which a routable address might be configured
   for the interface include:

   * Manual configuration
   * Address assignment through DHCP
   * Roaming of the host to a network on which the host has a valid
     routable address

   If a host finds that a routable address is no longer assigned to
   an interface,  the host MAY identify a usable Link-Local IPv4 address
   (as described in section 2) and assign that address to the interface.
   Ways in which a routable address might no longer be assigned to an

I would go the extra step and say: "A routable address is an address that 
is either statically assigned or whose lease has not expired and that 
passes the reachability test described in section 2 of "Detection of 
Network Attachment (DNA) in IPv4" [DNAv4]."

Please also note the grammatical correction, "which" to "that". Is there 
any risk that some readers will parse "(static or unexpired) and reachable" 
as "static or (unexpired and reachable)"? If so, you might consider reordering:

"A routable address is an address that passes the reachability test 
described in section 2 of "Detection of Network Attachment (DNA) in IPv4" 
[DNAv4] and is either statically assigned or one whose lease is unexpired."

Because of the lack of subordination betweeen the "and" and the "or"
conjuctions, a programmer may interpret the text differently from a
marketeer.  And I'm not sure which version is "right", so wording
clarification I believe is necessary.

Philip's change removes this issue but doesn't fix my implementation
question.

Just to clarify my understanding, If the reachability test described in
DNAv4 is skipped, or fails, then IPv4LL can't have a "valid" address, simply
it will have a "routable" address.  In that event, I may assign an IPv4LL
address additionally on that interface, right?

Best regards

Jim Busse

I most emphatically do NOT wish to impede progress (in particular, since I 
have been an interested observer and not a contributor), but "valid" does 
not convey any meaning beyond what "routable" conveys. I understand your 
example and the difficulty caused by lack of normative text to 
reference---but I suggest you improve matters by adequately explaining what 
"routable" means in the context of your draft. I agree with Bernard that 
"valid" is white noise.

Sounds like a good idea to me---but do it in the context of "routable" 
rather than "valid".

I think there is a distinction between "configured" and "useable".  I'm
not entirely clear what "useable" means here -- is this an address that is
configured, but might be only useable for receiving but not sending
packets?  If so, then it might make more sense to talk about "active" or
"deprecated" addresses than "valid" ones.

[DNAv4] uses the reachability test to determine whether to do DHCPv4 or
not, not to decide "validity" as discussed here.  It could be that a
configured IPv4 routable address fails the reachability test, because
the default gateway failed, but then a subsequent DHCPDISCOVER obtains
the same IP address, but a different default gateway.  In this case
configuring an IPv4 LL address in between the reachability test and the
DHCP conversation would be a bad idea.

I'm somewhat uncomfortable with where the spec is going with some of these
considerations because while it is citing [DNAv4], the implied behavior is

"Just to clarify my understanding, If the reachability test described in

simply it will have a "routable" address.  In that event, I may assign an
IPv4LL address additionally on that interface, right?"

This might not be a good idea if it's likely that a routable address will
eventually be assigned, since it will cause excessive address changes.
For example in IEEE 802.11, it could be that the reachability test failed
because of packet loss and a subsequent DHCPDISCOVER would succeed.  Is it
helpful to have an IPv4LL address assigned so as to cause existing
connections to go down?  Not necessarily.

In general, the recommended practice is for the host to only assign an
IPV4LL address when it is "likely" that no routable address will be
assigned.  This could occur for example when 802.11 adhoc or Bluetooth PAN
is in use.

>=20

The term "routable" is clearly defined:

   "This document uses the term "routable address" to refer to all
   unicast IPv4 addresses outside the 169.254/16 prefix, including
   global addresses and private addresses such as Net 10/8 [RFC1918],
   all of which may be forwarded via routers."

"configured" is not explicitly defined but I would assume that if I type =
"ifconfig eth0 5.6.7.8" then I have "configured" that address. =
Similarly, if DHCP has handed me the address 5.6.7.8 and my lease is =
still valid then that address is configured and because it conforms to =
the definition above it is a "configured routable address".

This tells me nothing about whether the address can be successfully used =
in any way. The useability of an address depends largely on the routing =
tables of other hosts on the same link and/or on the accessibility of =
routers which will recognise the presence of the address and route =
traffic to and from it. The reachability test of DNAv4 is a quick but =
rough test of the second part of this.

As Bernard pointed out - if the default router is down it doesn't mean =
that an address is totally unuseable - it may still work fine for =
communications which are on-link or via other routers.

On the other hand, if I have the "configured routable address" 5.6.7.8 =
but am sitting on a network 200.0.0.x many hops away from my default =
router and with no other local hosts aware of my presence then 5.6.7.8 =
will not be useable and for now I would be better off with a LL address.

The term "valid" could possibly be replaced with "useable" or "working"  =
but is not redundant.

Bernard is right - the DNAv4 reachability test is only a rough guide to =
the appropriateness of an address configuration. It can even give a =
false positive - e.g. when I have the address 10.x.y.z configured, I can =
move to another network where the 10/8 range is in use and where the =
reachability test is passed yet my address is not at all appropriate and =
may actually conlict.

As humans we can envisage lots of scenarios and because we can generally =
know something of the state of the whole network, we can usually decide =
quite clearly whether and when it is appropriate to assign an IPv4LL =
address.

From inside the host looking out, it is far less easy to know what is =
going on and come up with an algorithm which does the right thing in all =
cases. What we are trying to achieve is that implementers will =
understand the issues and devise algorithms which will do the right =
thing in the most common cases that they encounter.

The common cases encountered by a PDA with WiFi connectivity are likely =
to be different from a desktop computer with a wired interface, and =
different again from a small embedded device such as a scanner with a =
minimal user interface.

The reachability test includes determination that the MAC address of the
gateway is unchanged, so I think that case is covered.

And -
Replace

   This document uses the term "routable address" to refer to all
   unicast IPv4 addresses outside the 169.254/16 prefix, including
   global addresses and private addresses such as Net 10/8 [RFC1918],
   all of which may be forwarded via routers.

LL60
   REJECT.  The change was too large for most of the WG to accept at this
   phase.  I share concern that references within the document would change
   and require extensive editorial checking.


LL61
   ACCEPT.  The proposed solution is an amalgam of suggestions.

section 2.2.1 Text was:

   When ready to begin probing, the host should then wait for a random
   time interval selected uniformly in the range PROBE_MIN to PROBE_MAX
   seconds, and should then send NUM_PROBES probe packets, spaced
   randomly, PROBE_MIN to PROBE_MAX seconds apart.

Text becomes:

   When ready to begin probing, the host should then wait for a random
   time interval selected uniformly in the range zero to START_WAIT
   seconds, and should then send PROBE_NUM probe packets.  Each of
   these probe packets spaced randomly, PROBE_MIN to PROBE_MAX seconds
   apart.

Alex Eldar noted that we have to change our terminology for:

Was:
   If during this period, from the beginning of the probing process
   until PROBE_MAX seconds after the last probe packet is sent, the host

Becomes:
   If during this period, from the beginning of the probing process
   until DEFEND_INTERVAL seconds after the last probe packet is sent, the host

And was:
   If, by PROBE_MAX seconds after the transmission of the last ARP probe
   no conflicting ARP Reply or ARP probe has been received, then the
   host has successfully claimed the desired IPv4 Link-Local address.

Becomes:
   If, by DEFEND_INTERVAL seconds after the transmission of the last ARP probe
   no conflicting ARP Reply or ARP probe has been received, then the
   host has successfully claimed the desired IPv4 Link-Local address.

LL62
   REJECT: This was consensus to reject the issue, though not strong
   consensus.
   Dissent: More than one contributor felt that the additional random
   delays are unnecessary - that a fixed delay between probes is
   sufficient.  Their arguments did not convince others in the WG.

LL63
   OPEN - further discussion needed

LL64

LL53:

Several suggestions and comments had to be merged.  Please respond by
June 2 if there are any comments on this proposed resolution.  If no
comments are received, I will assume the change will be accepted as
stated, below.

--------------------------------------------

I received 3 direct emails supporting the suggested change of section 3.1
below and Bernard agreed.

Those who responded supported the additional text for the constants,
suggested by Stuart.

Since LL69 was rejected, and there was no support for the additional text
that Stuart suggested, most of the text added was dropped in the below
proposed resolution.

Please note that I left the text "Future standards documents..." which
I think is excellent.  It captures the thread which Mika and others
championed.

--------------------------------------------

Section 9, From:

   The following timing constants are used in this protocol; they are
   not intended to be user configurable.

   PROBE_MIN              1 second
   PROBE_MAX              2 seconds
   ANNOUNCE_INTERVAL      2 seconds
   PROBE_N                2
   ANNOUNCE_N             2
   NUM_PROBES             3
   MAX_COLLISIONS        10
   WATCH_WAIT            10 seconds
   RATE_LIMIT_INTERVAL   60 seconds

To:

   The following timing constants are used in this protocol; they are
   not intended to be user configurable.

   START_WAIT           1 second   (initial random delay)
   PROBE_MIN            1 second   (minimum delay till repeated probe)
   PROBE_MAX            2 seconds  (maximum delay till repeated probe)
   PROBE_NUM            3          (number of probe packets)
   PROBE_INTERVAL       1 second   (time between probe packets)
   ANNOUNCE_NUM         2          (number of announcement packets)
   ANNOUNCE_INTERVAL    2 seconds  (time between announcement packets)
   RATE_LIMIT_NUM      10          (max collisions before rate limiting)
   RATE_LIMIT_INTERVAL 60 seconds  (delay between successive attempts)
   DEFEND_INTERVAL     10 seconds  (minimum time between defensive ARPs)

   Future standards documents, extending IPv4 Link-Local Addressing to
   media types other than those covered in this document, may specify
   different values for these constants.

And:

Sec. 3.1 from

    Link-layer technologies that support ARP but operate at rates below 1
    Mbps or latencies above one second may need to specify different
    values for the following parameters described in Sections 2.2, 2.3
    and 2.4:

    (a) the number of, and interval between, ARP probes,
    (b) the number of, and interval between, ARP announcements,
    (c) the maximum rate at which address claiming may be attempted, and
    (d) the time interval between conflicting ARPs below which a host
        MUST reconfigure instead of attempting to defend its address.

LL63:

This issue remains open for discussion till June 2, 2004.

Note that the text in this section was created as a result of
collaboration with Ted Lemon and others in the DHC WG.  We cannot view
it as having been added erroneously or accidentally.

Please indicate which of the following options you prefer.

A) Leave the text as

   A device that implements both IPv4 Link-Local and a DHCPv4 client
   should not alter  the behavior of the DHCPv4 client to accommodate
   IPv4 Link-Local  configuration. In particular configuration of an
   IPv4 Link-Local address,  whether or not a DHCP server is currently
   responding, is not sufficient  reason to unconfigure a valid DHCP
   lease, to stop the DHCP client from  attempting to acquire a new IP
   address, to change DHCP timeouts or to  change the behavior of the
   DHCP state machine in any other way.

   Several early implementations of IPv4 Link-Local have modified the
   DHCP  state machine in an attempt to make IPv4 Link-Local more
   reliable, and the  field experience we have gained from this has
   shown that it does not work  - reliability of DHCP service is
   significantly reduced.   If increased reliability of IPv4 Link-Local
   is desired, we recommend that the IPv4 Link-Local state machine track
   the DHCP client state machine and, in cases where it is not certain
   that the DHCP-assigned address is correct, the  IPv4 Link-Local state
   machine acquire an IPv4 Link-Local address without causing the DHCP
   state machine to relinquish its address.

B) Replace the text in A) with

   As documented in Appendix A, early implementations of IPv4
   Link-Local have modified the DHCP state machine.  Field experience
   shows that these modifications reduce the reliability of the DHCP
   service.

   A device that implements both IPv4 Link-Local and a DHCPv4 client

LL70

This issue will remain open for comment until June 2, 2004.
After that point, if no comments are received, the issue will be
resolved by making DNAv4 normative and leaving the text as it currently
stands.

Bernard suggests the following resolution, which should allow DNAv4 to
remain an informative reference.

Was:
1.9.  When to configure a Link-Local IPv4 address

   Having addresses of multiple different scopes assigned to an
   interface, with no adequate way to determine in what circumstances
   each address should be used, leads to complexity for applications and
   confusion for users.  A host with an address on a link can
   communicate with all other devices on that link, whether those
   devices use Link-Local addresses, or routable addresses.  For these
   reasons, a host SHOULD NOT have both a valid routable address and a
   Link-Local IPv4 address configured on the same interface.


   A routable address is any address that is:

   * a unicast address (see Section 1.2)
   * not a loopback address
   * not contained within the 169.254/16 prefix reserved for Link-Local
      IPv4 addresses

   A "valid routable address" is a routable address that passes the
   reachability test described in section 2 of "Detection of Network
   Attachment (DNA) in IPv4" [DNAv4].

   The assignment and use of a Link-Local IPv4 address on an interface
   is based solely on the state of the interface, and is independent of
   any other protocols such as DHCP.  A host MUST NOT alter its behavior
   and use of other protocols such as DHCP because the host has assigned
   a Link-Local IPv4 address to an interface.

   When an interface has a valid routable address configured on an
   interface, the host SHOULD NOT also assign a Link-Local IPv4 address
   to that interface.

   If a host finds that an interface that was previous configured with a
   Link-Local IPv4 address is now configured with a valid routable
   address, the host MUST always use the routable address when
   initiating new communications, and MUST cease advertising the
   availability of the Link-Local IPv4 address through whatever
   mechanisms that address had been made known to others.  The host
   SHOULD continue to use the Link-Local IPv4 address for communications
   underway when the routable address was configured, and MAY continue
   to accept new communications addressed to the Link-Local IPv4
   address.  Ways in which a valid routable address might be configured
   for the interface include:

   * Manual configuration
   * Address assignment through DHCP
   * Roaming of the host to a network on which a routable address
      assigned to the interface is valid

   If a host finds that an interface that was previously configured with
   a valid routable address no longer has a valid routable address, the
   host MAY identify a usable Link-Local IPv4 address (as described in
   section 2) and assign that address to the interface.  Ways in which a
   valid routable address might no longer be assigned to an interface
   include:

   * Removal of the address from the interface through manual
      configuration
   * Expiration of the lease on the address assigned through DHCP
   * Roaming of the host to a new network on which the address is no
     longer valid.

   Further discussion of the issues in detection of transient failures
   and the use of DHCP in response to network attachment failure is
   provided in "Detection of Network Attachment (DNA) in IPv4". [DNAv4]

   attachment is provided in [DNAv4].

The resolutions which I included in this message are my reading of the
discussion in the preceeding last call periods.  If you believe that I
have misread the consensus, please bring this up on the working group
mailing list.  I remind participants that a very high degree of agreement
is needed to make a change at this late in the process.

I will not be able to respond to the ensuing discussion until Monday 31
May.

I am in favour of parameterizing WATCH_WAIT but we should do it =
properly. As proposed the *parameter* WATCH_WAIT is specific to IEEE802. =
It should be the *value* of WATCH_WAIT that is IEE802 specific - other =
transports may get different values for the same parameter. The text =
should read:

"...and it has not seen any other conflicting ARP packets within =
WATCH_WAIT seconds then it MAY elect..."

and add in section 9:
WATCH_WAIT    10 seconds for IEEE 802 networks

Erik,

1. WATCH_WAIT seems to have disappeared in the proposed change to =
section 9. It should not have done.

2. You have got your knickers in a twist over PROBE_INTERVAL and =
DEFEND_INTERVAL. Alex Elder proposed using PROBE_INTERVAL in a comment =
on LL61. This has been accepted in your resolution to LL61 but you have =
changed the name to DEFEND_INTERVAL. Now in the proposed parameter text =
for LL53 you have both but with wildly different values!

3. PROBE_INTERVAL is not "time between probe packets". It is "wait time =
after last probe packet" and I can find nothing in the discussion that =
defines DEFEND_INTERVAL as "minimum time between defensive ARPs".

3. We now have 5 parameters for the probing process and there is clearly =
confusion over their meaning. I would like to see clearer naming: =
NUM_PROBES, PRE_PROBE_MAX, INTER_PROBE_MIN, INTER_PROBE_MAX, =
POST_PROBE_WAIT.

4. The new text of 3.1(a) should name all 5 of the probing parameters =
thus:

    (a) the number and timing of ARP probes
        See NUM_PROBES, PRE_PROBE_MAX, INTER_PROBE_MIN, INTER_PROBE_MAX,
        POST_PROBE_WAIT defined in section 2.2.1

Philip

I support the principle that DNAv4 should become informative rather than =
normative - espescially as recent discussions here have shown that the =
reachability test of DNAv4 is a guide rather than a final and decisive =
test of the useability of an address.

I do not support the resolution text as it stands for several reasons:

1. (editorial) an extra meaningless paragraph has appeared which is a =
combination of two others:

>    When an interface has a routable address configured on an =
interface,
>    is based solely on the state of the interface, and is independent =
of
>    any other protocols such as DHCP.  A host MUST NOT alter its =
behavior
>    and use of other protocols such as DHCP because the host has =
assigned
>    an IPv4 Link-Local address to an interface.

2. (editorial) "When an interface has a routable address configured on =
an interface" needs to be changed. The paragraph should read:

   When a routable address is configured on an interface,
   the host SHOULD NOT also assign an IPv4 Link-Local address to that
   interface.

3. (substantive) as I have said in previous discussion, the term "valid" =
carries meaning that is lost when it is simply dropped as here. I would =
rather keep the term "valid" (or "working" or "useable") and leave its =
definition fuzzy if necessary. I don't believe the proposed text =
adequately resolves this issue.

    If a host finds that an interface that was previous[ly] configured
    with an IPv4 Link-Local address is now configured with a routable=20
    address, the host MUST use the routable address when initiating new=20
    communications...

I would interpret this text as a firm injunction preventing me from =
using IPv4LL on any interface which has a routable address however wrong =
and unuseable that address is. The only get out is weasle words about =
the meaning of "configured".

I also support the principle that DNAv4 should become informative.  I gave
DNAv4 to a network apps developer, and he implemented the reachability test
described in DNAv4 differently from the way I interpreted and implemented
it.

As has been pointed out before, the assignment of IP addresses to interfaces
is primarily an operating systems issue.  Since most net apps are sockets
apps,  most net applications won't be able to assign an IPv4LL address.  So
I think Apple, Microsoft, and Sun (alphabetically) should come up with the
advisory wording.

The issue was discussed a year ago.  The thread was: "New issue: When to
configure a LL address."  Instead of flailing a dead horse, could the
wording be taken from that thread?  From Stuart (reproduced here without
permission):

"The one-and-only truly accurate way to determine whether operation A will
succeed is to try doing operation A, and see if it succeeds. (Those with
a formal computer science background will recognize this as a trivial
re-statement of the halting problem.)

Any attempt to determine whether operation A (e.g. connect to
www.amazon.com) will succeed by first performing some different operation
B (e.g. ping the DHCP server) is plagued by false positives and false
negatives.

False positive: Just because the DHCP server responds doesn't mean you
have a path all the way to www.amazon.com and back.

False negative: Just because the DHCP server doesn't respond doesn't mean
you *don't* have a path all the way to www.amazon.com and back.

Therefore, the best and simplest test to see whether a routable address
will work is to try it, and if it does not work, to try an alternative
instead."

I support the principle that DNAv4 should become informative rather than
normative - espescially as recent discussions here have shown that the
reachability test of DNAv4 is a guide rather than a final and decisive test
of the useability of an address.

I do not support the resolution text as it stands for several reasons:

1. (editorial) an extra meaningless paragraph has appeared which is a
combination of two others:

>    When an interface has a routable address configured on an interface,
>    is based solely on the state of the interface, and is independent of
>    any other protocols such as DHCP.  A host MUST NOT alter its behavior
>    and use of other protocols such as DHCP because the host has assigned
>    an IPv4 Link-Local address to an interface.

2. (editorial) "When an interface has a routable address configured on an
interface" needs to be changed. The paragraph should read:

   When a routable address is configured on an interface,
   the host SHOULD NOT also assign an IPv4 Link-Local address to that
   interface.

3. (substantive) as I have said in previous discussion, the term "valid"
carries meaning that is lost when it is simply dropped as here. I would
rather keep the term "valid" (or "working" or "useable") and leave its
definition fuzzy if necessary. I don't believe the proposed text adequately
resolves this issue.

    If a host finds that an interface that was previous[ly] configured
    with an IPv4 Link-Local address is now configured with a routable
    address, the host MUST use the routable address when initiating new
    communications...

I would interpret this text as a firm injunction preventing me from using
IPv4LL on any interface which has a routable address however wrong and
unuseable that address is. The only get out is weasle words about the
meaning of "configured".

Philip

The following paragraph (which Philip and others objected to) was not
included in my original proposal, so I'd agree that it is meaningless
and should be deleted:

"   When an interface has a routable address configured on an interface,
   is based solely on the state of the interface, and is independent of
   any other protocols such as DHCP.  A host MUST NOT alter its behavior
   and use of other protocols such as DHCP because the host has assigned
   an IPv4 Link-Local address to an interface."

I also agree with Philip's proposed editorial improvement:

"  When a routable address is configured on an interface,
   the host SHOULD NOT also assign an IPv4 Link-Local address to that
   interface."

In terms of the substantative issue, I agree with Philip that it makes no
sense to prevent a host from using IPv4LL on an interface that has an
incorrect or unuseable routable address.  But I'm not clear that the term
"valid" (at least in the DNAv4 usage) is helpful in making this
clear.

IMHO, the only thing that matters in a given situation is whether the host
will use a given address to source packets or will accept packets destined
to that address.  This can differ between existing connections
and new connections.

Unfortunately, I think the text contradicts itself in places, using
SHOULD and SHOULD NOT normative language to describe the same
behavior.

Here is the proposed text with Philip's two editorial comments
incorporated. Comments/improvements/edits welcome.

"  Having addresses of multiple different scopes assigned to an
   interface, with no adequate way to determine in what circumstances
   each address should be used, leads to complexity for applications and
   confusion for users.  A host with an address on a link can
   communicate with all other devices on that link, whether those
   devices use Link-Local addresses, or routable addresses.  For these
   reasons, a host SHOULD NOT have both a routable address and an IPv4
   Link-Local address configured on the same interface.  When
   a routable address is configured on an interface, the host SHOULD NOT
   also assign an IPv4 Link-Local address on that interface.

   The assignment of an IPv4 Link-Local address on an interface
   is based solely on the state of the interface, and is independent of
   any other protocols such as DHCP.  A host MUST NOT alter its behavior
   and use of other protocols such as DHCP because the host has assigned
   an IPv4 Link-Local address to an interface.

   If a host finds that an interface that was previously configured with
   an IPv4 Link-Local address is now configured with a routable address,
   the host MUST use the routable address when initiating new
   communications, and MUST cease advertising the availability of the
   IPv4 Link-Local address through whatever mechanisms that address had
   been made known to others.  The host SHOULD continue to use the IPv4
   Link-Local address for communications underway when the routable
   address was configured, and MAY continue to accept new communications
   addressed to the IPv4 Link-Local address.  Ways in which a routable
   address might be configured for the interface include:

   * Manual configuration
   * Address assignment through DHCP
   * Roaming of the host to a network on which the host has a
        valid routable address

   If a host finds that a routable address is no longer configured on an
   interface, the host MAY identify a usable IPv4 Link-Local address (as
   described in section 2) and assign that address to the interface.
   Ways in which a routable address might no longer be configured on an
   interface include:

   * Removal of the address from the interface through manual
      configuration
   * Expiration of the lease on the address assigned through DHCP
   * Roaming of the host to a new network on which the address is no
        longer valid.

   Further discussion of address assignment and the detection of network
   attachment is provided in [DNAv4]."

I've been reading the proposed text again, and as noted earlier, am not
sure what it means.  Some questions below:

"For these reasons, a host SHOULD NOT have both a routable address and an
IPv4 Link-Local address configured on the same interface.  When
a routable address is configured on an interface, the host SHOULD NOT
also assign an IPv4 Link-Local address on that interface."

What does it mean to have an address "configured" on an interface?  Can
a host send a packet with a source address if the address isn't
configured, and can a host receive a packet destined to an
address without it being configured? Does "assigning" an address to an
interface mean that this address is "configured"?

"  If a host finds that an interface that was previously configured with
   an IPv4 Link-Local address is now configured with a routable address,
   the host MUST use the routable address when initiating new
   communications, and MUST cease advertising the availability of the
   IPv4 Link-Local address through whatever mechanisms that address had
   been made known to others. "

This paragraph appears to define what it means to "configure" an
address:  the address is used when initiating new connections and when
advertising availability of an address.

" The host SHOULD continue to use the IPv4
Link-Local address for communications underway when the routable
address was configured, and MAY continue to accept new communications
addressed to the IPv4 Link-Local address."

According to this paragraph an address that is not "configured" can be
used as the source address of packets (for connections that were already
underway), and can be a destination address either for connections that
were already underway or for new connections.

"  If a host finds that a routable address is no longer configured on an
   interface, the host MAY identify a usable IPv4 Link-Local address (as
   described in section 2) and assign that address to the interface."

Does "assigning" a Link-Local address imply that this address is now
"configured" as described above?  I think the answer is yes -- this
address will be used as the source address as new connections.

Based on these observations, I'd recommend that the following definition
be added to the terminology section:

"Configured Address
   A configured address is an address that the host may use in
   initiating new connections, and also in advertising address
   availability.  A configured address is also an address on
   which a host is willing to receive packets."

Using this definition, the proposed text reads as follows:

"  Having addresses of multiple different scopes configured on an
   interface, with no adequate way to determine in what circumstances
   each address should be used, leads to complexity for applications and
   confusion for users.  A host with an address on a link can
   communicate with all other devices on that link, whether those
   devices use Link-Local addresses, or routable addresses.  For these
   reasons, a host SHOULD NOT have both a routable address and an IPv4
   Link-Local address configured on the same interface.  When
   a routable address is configured on an interface, the host SHOULD NOT
   also configure an IPv4 Link-Local address on that interface.

   The configuration of an IPv4 Link-Local address on an interface
   is based solely on the state of the interface, and is independent of
   any other protocols such as DHCP.  A host MUST NOT alter its behavior
   and use of other protocols such as DHCP because the host has configured
   an IPv4 Link-Local address to an interface.

   If a host finds that an interface that was previously configured with
   an IPv4 Link-Local address is now configured with a routable address,
   the host MUST use the routable address when initiating new
   communications, and MUST cease advertising the availability of the
   IPv4 Link-Local address through whatever mechanisms that address had

   * Manual configuration
   * Address assignment through DHCP
   * Roaming of the host to a network on which the host has a
        valid routable address

      configuration
   * Expiration of the lease on the address assigned through DHCP
   * Roaming of the host to a new network on which the address is no
        longer valid.

   network attachment is provided in [DNAv4]."

I think the resolution of LL 58 re-introduces a normative
dependency on [DNAv4].  The proposed resolution is:

"  This document uses the term "routable address" to refer to all valid
   unicast IPv4 addresses outside the 169.254/16 prefix that may be
   forwarded via routers.  This includes all global addresses and
   private addresses such as Net 10/8 [RFC1918], but not loopback
   addresses such as 127.0.0.1."

Yet the term "valid" is defined by reference to [DNAv4] in Section 1.9:

"
A valid routable address is a routable address that passes
the reachability test described in section 2 of "Detection of Network
Attachment (DNA) in IPv4" [DNAv4]."

My recommendation would be to delete the term "valid" from the
definition of "routable address", and also to delete the definition of
valid in Section 1.9 and add the following definition
to the terminology section:

   A "valid routable address" is a routable address which is either
   statically assigned or whose lease has not expired and that passes
   the reachability test described in section 2 of "Detection of Network
   Attachment (DNA) in IPv4" [DNAv4].

In looking over LL56, I think the debate disclosed that the text
really was unclear.  So while there may not have been consensus for
Stuart's proposed change, I do think that the text needs to be
clarified.

For example, the text states:

"IPv4 addresses and names which can only be resolved on the local link
SHOULD NOT be forwarded, they SHOULD only be sent when a Link-Local
address is used as the source address.  This strong advice should hinder
limited scope addresses and names from leaving the context in
which they apply."

This text really is unclear.  It could be read (and was ready by Stuart
and myself) as implying that an LLMNR Response (even one not
including a Link-Local address in the RRs) SHOULD only be
sent when a Link-Local address is used as the source address.

The issue text appears to imply that in fact the following was meant:

"IPv4 addresses and names which can only be resolved on the local link
SHOULD NOT be forwarded beyond the local link.  IPv4 Link-Local addresses
SHOULD only be sent when a Link-Local address is used as the source
address.  This strong advice should hinder limited scope addresses
and names from leaving the context in which they apply."

The LL61 proposed resolution defines PROBE_NUM and DEFEND_INTERVAL.
However, values for these constants are not suggested in Section 9.

We do have PROBE_N (defined as 2) and NUM_PROBES (defined as 3).

Yes (that was always there), but ...

does nothing to change that, it is still a normative reference.

The proposal is to make this a definition in the terminology section, and
remove all normative uses of the term "valid".   With the changes, the
only use of the term in the document is to describe ways in which an
address *might* be configured.
