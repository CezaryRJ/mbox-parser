Ah...the infamous 'if' clause. That is not the same as intelligent handling
of conflicts. That's just closing your eyes and hoping for good to happen
instead of evil. Intelligent handling of conflicts by the protocol is a far
better idea...works quite well too.

I will bet one of my really nasty tacky hawaiian shirts that if you ask one
hundred non-engineers how they find things in a phone book, they look for
the base category first. I've tried to set things up the way you are
advocating, it just does not ever work in the real world, where engineers
aren't the only customer. I've actually found that configuring things the
way engineers like it is a bad thing in far too many cases.

Oh stop yelling. For years I had a set of printers with the following names:

HP Laser 5SI
HP Laser 5SI/MX
HP Laser 4SI
Apple Laserwriter Iig
Tektronix Phaser 740
Tektronix Phaser 550

The phasers were the color printers. I had tell new employees no more than
once which color printer was on their floor. If they asked which printer did
duplexing, I told them once. Since all the printers were set up on their
machines, they would most times just see which printers did what, and move
on. You can yell and scream about it, but simple names work. Why? Because
they only ever normally saw five of those printers. The IIg was a fax server
printer.

Even doing work in fortune 500 companies, I set things up so that no zone
had more than printers. Why? Because IVR experience taught me that no matter
how you name something, people lose track of  list's contents when you give
them more than 4-5 choices. Hell, I wrote IVR systems, and to this day, I
lose track after 4-5 items. Thank god for fingers.

You tell me how many hi-speed lasers get shut off and moved around all the
time The things weigh a friggin TON...they don't move at all, therefore,
they never lose their name. As well, they take a dog's age to warm up, so
they never get turned off, therefore, they never lose their name. If the
printers are ad hoc, then you have one, perhaps two, and it's not an issue
so small a number of choices.

UPS's and backup power are just ALL the rage in the 21st century, you should
really try it. In ten+ years of IT, I've had exactly one power outage that
lasted more than two hours. The generation plant next door had a fire. It
was really cool...and we had our UPS's handle it nicely.

How? It can't handle a SRV record that reads "4th floor
HP._ipp.tcp.mit.edu"? You mean to say that a system that handles *billions*
of lookups every day is going to fall down because we use it to find
printers...which is just a specific type of host anyway? If that's the case,
then screw mDNS, you should be fixing DNS period.

Anyone who puts 1000 hosts in a flat hierarchy is an idiot, and will soon be
fired, regardless of browser protocol. You wouldn¹t run that on an ad hoc
network, it would be a bad implementation. DNS-SD isn't restricted to ad
hoc, it just works there very well too.

Service discover...give me a list of printers. If there are too many, the
humans yell at the humans, and the humans fix it. But I'm telling you that
in the world, you search for printers. Printers near you. If they happen to
have good names, great, but you search for printers. DNS-SD doesn't preclude
meaningful names, but they aren't the showstoppers you want them to be.

It's a great way to do it, it does it now. You just aren't seeing that. But
it does. SLP sucks ass to implement. I've tried to. I'd rather go back to
Netware 3, it had better tools.

no it's not.  But DNS does what it does, warts and all.  That's not a justification

yes, they'll look for restaurants which in a moderately sized city will have
hundreds of entries.  after that, however, they may look for chinese
restaurants or they might look for restaurants arranged by locality.
they're listed in multiple orders for a reason, you know.

the only thing I'm strongly advocating in this case is to NOT SCREW UP DNS
or applications that use the DNS query interface.  have you really tried to 
set things up so that applications that query DNS really get DNS and found
that things don't work well that way?  because I find that they do.

most organizations don't have UPSes for every system - certainly not for
laser printers (those things *eat* power)

and for what it's worth, 4-8 hour power failures are fairly common in some
places. (we have lots of trees here, and for the most part, we happen to like 
'em...  but occasionally we also have violent storms and some of the trees 
fall on power lines.  not much we can do about it other than to bury the
power lines, and that's too expensive)

no I'm saying that you'll be screwing applications because you're expecting
them to do things with the DNS interface that the DNS interface wasn't
designed to do.  now if you make this a separate protocol with a separate
programming interface, I have less problem with it (though I think it's 
still a fairly brain-dead design, but at least it won't screw up other things)

are you talking DNS hierarchy or IP router hierarchy?  because 1000 hosts
in a subnet can be quite reasonable. 

(fwiw, the 1000 host figure is rounded from the v4 linklocal spec - if we
expect ad hoc networks to support 1000 hosts then it seems reasonable
to make similar expectations of the resource discovery mechanism - either
that or derate the overall expectations for the size of ad hoc networks)

No, I'm seeing people try to break DNS and applications on a large scale.

This isn't 'screwing it up'. In fact, it's a lot better than creating
multiple complex protocols that require separate tools to manage and deal
with, that use their own methodology, because heaven knows, you can't just
adapt an existing standard...oh no, we have to have a completely different
protcol, and over engineer it so that it's never done, and impossible to
implement sanely across platforms

But they all live under restaurants. They don't live under 'buildings, zoned
commercial, with active health permits, that serve food, that is chinese'.
You start simple, and work your way to complex. Proper browsing is the same
way.

Nope. I've found it works well, but can suck to set up. DNS-SD and mDNS help
with that from what I can tell, and it's NOT going to screw up DNS. DNS is
robust enough to handle telling me the IP address of a printer as well as a
web server. Again, if it's that fragile, then why not replace DNS, since
it's obviously not robust enough to handle any extensions at all.

You need it for stable networks too. DHCP sucks to set up and use, so does
manual IPs. Manual IPs suck less than DHCP but not by much. Using DHCP to
get your DNS servers sucks, it never works consistently.

Massachusetts has trees too.....we also have line crews. In any event,
zeroconf doesn't preclude you from statically assigning things.

Oh great...so now I have to reconfigure my routers and wait for how many
years to debug this brand new magical protocol that will make IP work like
APpleTalk...I've been waiting for a long time now...SLP ain't it. What
magical protocol will work like this. And won't require router/firewall/etc
reconfiguration? And won't be waiting forever for clients...I don't see a
lot of SLP clients out there. Hell *Apple* isn't using it for print
browsing, and they helped create the bloody thing! and unless the
Applications are doing funky things with DNS *anyway*, how will allowing for
new features break them?

1000 hosts in a flat subnet is still quite stupid. At that point, you are
begging for network problems. That's why you then subnet even further, and
use DNS to help you. Using flat DNS hierarchies and 1000 host subnets is
just dumb.

That level of ad hoc is going to be highly uncommon, but even so, I have
more confidence in DNS's ability to scale than I do anything that so far is
a dream.

I have yet to see convincing proof that that will happen. So far, every
other attempt at what Stuart is advocating has been feces, so I'm liking the
DNS theory a lot, *especially* as an IT geek.

This thread is heading into the weeds and seems to me to miss the point almost
entirely.

It is the job of user interface designers to sort, filter, process and
otherwise munge the information they are dealing with before presenting it to
the user. They do so whether they are using SLP or DNS-SD. If they have a rich
set of information they can choose to discard or hide some of it at will. If
they have a sparse set it not so easy to create more and the user can be left
wanting.

If there are only 4 or 5 printers available then the name might be enough. If
there are 40 or 50 then having further information available allows the clever
software designer - not the user - to find ways to partition the choices and
make them more presentable.

If the user habitually uses PrinterA but needs for a special purposes every
few months or years to find one with a stapler then that information should be
available without having to call a human. This doesn't mean that the user
interface has to thrust the fact that the printer has a stapler down the
user's throat all the time. There are plenty of ways user interfaces do this
sort of thing all the time.

There are two extremes of philosophy at work here:
1. Concentrate all the information gathering into a single place where it can
be accessed and processed together. SLP tends to this extreme approach.

2. Put just enough at each level to get you to the next: Having found printers
through DNS-SD, you use a print queueing protocol to find whether it supports
postscript, you then use postscript to find its screen resolution etc. If you
are interested in file servers on the other hand you discover them with DNS-SD
but then use FTP, SMB, NFS etc to find more about them.

The trouble with method 1 is knowing where to draw the line - do you present
all the file names on a server as attributes in SLP? or just its volumes? or
simply its name?. The trouble with method 2 is that a generalised browser such
as the chooser or even the finder has to "know" all those other protocols or
techniques to be able to present more information. In practice of course most
solutions are a compromise between the two.

In general, the more work that has to be done to implement a protocol, the
less likely you will see it implemented at all. TCP/IP is dead simple to
implement...of course, it's also quite stupid at some levels as well, but
the simplicity leads to wider, and faster adoption. There have been a number
of 'rich' protocols for this sort of thing, yet almost none of them are in
use today. That is not a minor point.

But how, without creating an overly complex browser interface? Even with
IPP, all you get is an icon, and a name. That's all most browser interfaces
use. How do you easily and quickly display this information that you are
regarding as critical? Do you gather it all on the initial list build and
then display it in the browser window? That creates a lot of traffic every
time a browser window is opened, since a high end printer can have a rather
large number of characteristics. If you figure on ten potential data fields
at a K per field, then that's 10K per device that's collected, used or not.
If you only collect it when the device is selected in the printer, then you
don't have the large bursts, but now every click is sending requests,
replies, verification, oops a collision, resend the packets...the GUI not
withstanding, if you start dumping that kind of traffic, IT admins are going
to shut your protocol down with prejudice.

As well, the protocol should allow for simple partitioning of presentation,
ala AppleTalk.

Um...if you decide to advertise printer capabilities while browsing, you're
advertising them all the time, or none of the time. You can use the name of
the printer, within reason, to do this. But I've found that if treated
intelligently, most users act that way.

And SLP's inability to be anything but an interesting test case in the real
world shows the value in this. It makes implementation harder.

The real problem is that OS X may do it one way, OS Y another, and OS Z a
third way, unless you require all information to be displayed as a
compatibility requirement. One way, you can have completely different views
of the same thing, the other way, you can't browse for printers on anything
smaller than a 21" screen.

But the 'knowing' is *far* simpler in method 2, and because it is simpler,
you get a much better rate of consistent implementations, which makes the
humans happy.

This is for the GUI designer to decide but if you really need some examples:
- A context menu can give further options when a printer is selected.
- The browser window can have a "View" menu which allows the user to make
selections.
- A "Find" option can be provided with hierarchical options.
- A preferences setting can hide printers which don't have A4 (or whatever)

The browser only has to query as much data as it needs to fulfil the user
requirements. If there are only one or two printers out there it just needs
their names. If there are 50 then some further information is needed - but not
all of it.

SLP with its generalised profiles provides one way to do this - it doesn't
force all those attributes on you unless asked - but it is certainly not the
only way.

You wouldn't say that about file browsing, why should it be so for printers?
Many users choose only to view a filename and icon. Others like to see
file-size, or creation date, or owner, or file type or some combination of
these - but they change their choice according to circumstances. A user will
often choose to see thumbnails of their pictures some of the time and a size
or date sorted list at others.

The "knowing" grows with the problem in method 2. The more kinds of thing to
be discovered, the more completely different protocols and techniques need to
be implemented. Even printers have many alternative protocols available.
Method 1 imposes a higher initial threshold, but once over that the problem
does not grow anything like so fast.

?? I don't follow this at all. Of course different OSes do things differently.

Personally (and as a great Mac advocate in former times) I always hated the
Chooser - largely because its clunky interface wasn't nearly so good as the
Finder - and I had to perform a mental context switch to go there. It always
felt like a throwback to System-4. Windows' integration of network browsing
with Explorer is much better in principle - though typically badly executed.

There! I never thought I would find myself advocating Windows anything! I
haven't used a Mac much for a few years now though, so things might have
changed there too.

This is only relevant to Zeroconf because it is a bad thing for the IETF or
Zeroconf to be advocating two solutions which overlap so badly. If they
overlapped completely it would probably be easy to pick one. If they hardly
overlapped at all, it would be easy to pick both.

on the other hand when you overload an existing protocol you inevitably 
get conflicts between the different uses of that protocol - as they 
try to pull the protocol in different directions.  so for instance we

we've known for decades that there are fundamental limits to hierarchical
tree-walking as a search mechanism.   from what you've said about network
configuration, your solution to the problem of browsing for food sources 
would apparently be to limit the number of chinese restaurants...

zeroconf isn't going to get rid of DHCP, because there are large numbers of
apps that you can't run with linklocal addresses.  stateless autoconfiguration
for v6 might help you get rid of DHCP, but that's not a product of zeroconf.

so they're going to stop printing just because there was a power failure
elsewhere?  it makes more sense to shut them down.  it certainly doesn't
make sense to supply each printer with a UPS just so it can keep its name...

What's so different? You're making a DNS request for information. It's a
different type of information, but all you want to do is find out if

a)  your host name already exists in your zone. Nothing major there.
b)  if there are any hosts that respond to a ._printer or a .ipp request.
Conceptually, this is not that much different than looking for something to
respond to a www request or an ftp request.

It is also easy to extend poorly, much easier than well. However, from the
administration POV, which is my domain, this is
a) simple 
b) coherent 
c) easy to understand and explain

SLP fails a and c, as do most other over-engineered protocols.

I also have found that simple tends to not break as easy as complex. But
then, I've not found too many engineers that could resist the urge to put
one more thing in to make anything cover every possible situation. OSI is a
*classic* example of this. The OSI protocol was far more capable, had more
features, was designed to handle everything well, and as a result, handled
absolutely nothing well, and was destroyed by a simplistic dinky thing like
TCP/IP.

Nope. Geography takes care of that. Phone books (domains) cover a specific
geographic area. That limits things before you even start. Bigger cities can
even break things down further geographically. That way, you aren't getting
hits from restaurants that are thirty miles or more away, unless you chose
to. So, for things that aren't dynamic, put them in non-dynamic zones.
Vanilla DNS can exist just fine with zeroconf, unless Stuart is having a
complete brain spasm about this, which I highly doubt.

No, your solution is to do *nothing* until perfection is achieved. That's
unacceptable. To get rid of AppleTalk browsing, you need a replacement.
Forcing people to memorize URLs is unacceptable. Requiring IT departments to
write custom interfaces for stuff is unacceptable. You will *never* achieve
perfection, nor purity, not in this universe anyway. So, you take the
simplest route that gets the job done, preferably using existing tools.
Reinventing the wheel is never the right solution.

It doesn't have to either. It can coexist with DHCP just fine. That's
another reason why it is an elegant solution...it doesn't require throwing
away what works. It simply fixes what is broken.

But then, you don't *have* to have dynamic names in that instance. You can
have static names, just like now. Zeroconf will work correctly with them.

It's either DNS or LDAP. Those are the only two protocols that will handle
this correctly. *Everyone* supports DNS far better than they do LDAP.
Besides, LDAP has to bury Netinfo first.

But since you are rabidly against zeroconf, I eagerly await your complete
solution/alternative to zeroconf.

Obviously. But if you set up your domain hierachy in a real hierachal
fashion rather than the standard flat host.something.com for everything,
then you can use DNS to make your life easier, and simpler via search
domains.

I've yet to see any protocol implement AppleTalk's services as elegantly.
AppleTalk 'just worked'. None of the so-called replacements 'just work'.
They 'eventually work with a lot of support'. Zeroconf is the first thing
that I've seen that looks to 'just work'. "Just working" is one of, if not
*the* major requirements for what we are talking about. If you have to do
more than activate a wireless link, or plug in an ethernet cable to get
basic services, It's too complex for what it needs to do.

Secondly, "Keep It Simple, Silly" is a very good rule to follow in anything.
I have yet to hear anyone explain SLP and the like completely and coherently
in under 30 minutes. I've seen zeroconf done in 10-15...simple is FAR harder
to do well than complex.

Just curious if anyone has heard from Xerox supporting Zeroconf directly?

Proposed standards have to have no technical problems  with respect to 
the requirements placed on them.  This stuff has severe technical 
problems, and so it doesn't meet the requirements.

Whoa...okay, this is a technical argument. Name calling is not going to do
anything constructive. I meant nothing personal, but what you are talking
about is the "perfect solution". Everyone would love it, but it won't ever
happen. You have to figure out the best solution for the existing problem
that will cause fewer problems than they fix. TCP/IP isn't the perfect
solution, but it works really well. DNS isn't the perfect solution to name
resolution, but it works really well. Zeroconf looks to fit that category.

You have yet to list concrete example of it failing to work. There are
enough "what if" problems in any solution to any problem that could keep any
solution from ever being implemented for any reason, even the wheel. So you
triage. There are some potential issues, but the spec and information I've
seen  look to have them under control in a logical manner. As well, it can
be explained thoroughly  and clearly in a relatively short amount of time.
That is a huge point in it's favor, as most real-world solutions that work
well can be explained in the same manner.

NO I AM NOT.  I'm just saying that what you are trying to do will cause
harm.  And for you to try to speak on my behalf is *really* offensive.

Um..okay, obviously, you are getting angry here, and since I'm not sure why,
I'm ending my participation in this thread. You have yet to clearly
establish the harm that zeroconf will cause, nor have you yet come up with a
clear alternative. Secondly, I'm *not* trying to speak on your behalf. That
would require me to misidentify myself as your representative, which I have
clearly not done. I'm pointing out what it looks, *to me* what you are
saying. 

Again, this is/was a technical argument, not a personal attack.

zeroconf is many things.

I've spoken out quite extensively on the problems with v4 linklocal
addresses, and recommended some reasonable solutions to those problems.

other things like mdns and dns service discovery need similar attention.

but I agree that this thread isn't accomplishing anything useful, so
I'll stop too.

Maybe I'm missing something obvious, but using the DNS, how exactly is
that intended to be accomplished?

The DNS is a truly lousy searching protocol, in fact, it is hard to
imagine one worse.   If you know the exact name that you want, it works
just fine.   If you don't, it is completely useless.

So, if there are 4 or 5 telnet servers (or printers to move towards the
more common example that has been being used), we know how to create the
name "_telnet._tcp" (or "_printer._tcp" or whatever) - that's defined by
the protocol in use.

We may know what domain that we're in (in some environments - but assume
we do), we may even know of some other domains we might like to look in
to find things.  Call this "example.com" just for the purposes of
argument here.

So, I need to find X such that "_telnet._tcp.X.example.com" exists.

What's the DNS method to achieve that?   I must have missed that sometime.

(or use a printer driver to convert it to xxx) first.

Similarly if I'm about to print a photograph, dumping it onto a line
printer (even offering me the choice to print it on "printer number 3")
isn't exactly useful.   The list I'm offered should be just those
printers that are capable of printing the data that I want to print.
The software can (should be able to) do that kind of filtering before
a human gets near the list of choices.

Yes, this is fine.    But on 98% of the printers like that that we have

of the printers will actually print colour.   How does the laserwriter
driver do on avoiding letting me (unintentionally anyway) send my nice
colour image to a printer that simply cannot cope?

we want to know yours.   It is fine (if you're able) to tell us "Apple is

Once upon a time vinyl LP's "just worked" and there was nothing better

Now, vinyl LP's ???

"completely" for SLP (as for NBP in appletalk) is hard to do quickly.

But for enough to understand how it works, "you ask on the net for
any devices that can service your request, which can be simple, or
can include extra requirements - anything out there which can handle
your request replies, and tells you what it can do, if there's more than
one, you pick (however you like, including popping up a "chooser" box
if you are actually going to have a human user to select), if there's
exactly one, well ... if there's less than one, then you either
try for lesser requirements, if possible, or give up."

That's it.   The rest is all boring detail that you don't need to know
to actually understand how it works.

Sound rather line NBP?   Aside from NBP being only able to locate names
of a given type (which actually is a truly lousy human interface to finding
things, as soon as there are more than just a couple), there really is no
difference.

From the user standpoint, no they haven't.

It took until the convenience of CDs to get people to move off of vinyl,
even though CD sound reproduction is just horrid compared to vinyl.

I'm not at all. But, it has to be easy to use, easy to implement, easy to
maintain, and easy to integrate. So far, I haven't seen anything that
matches all three. AppleTalk is not perfect on the last test, but only if
you hate non-IP protocols.

You aren't going to get anyone to implement a standard with that much
variation in the browser protocols. The average person will ignore most of
the options, and complain that it makes it too hard to use. Implementing the
more complex ones is a PITA from the other side, and jacks up network
traffic.

You know what? In my experience, people like names. We use names rather
well. "Stuart Cheshire" is hardly descriptive at all, and for someone who
doesn't know Stuart, absolutely meaningless. But for the people who deal
with Stuart, or have talked with him, then "Stuart Cheshire" is all you
need. You don't use the name to perfectly describe what you are looking for.
In our printer example, you find out which printer is the duplexing color
laser, "Oh, it's the one named 'HP third floor color' Great, you add it to
your list of printers. Now, when you need to print color, the name gives you
the start point, and your brain says, "Ah, that's the one that also does
duplexing". 

Seriously, names are what humans use. You don't go out to the movies with a
(for example) human female, 5'11", 140lbs, black hair 18" in length with a
light wave, green eyes, non-smoker, has a porsche, likes Wesley Snipes
movies, lives at x address with y phone number, and is allergic to sushi.

You go out with Janet. There's what, 175 million women in the united states,
but someone men keep straight the ones they are dating/living with/friends
with/married to, etc., just fine, and they do it pretty much by name alone.
They remember the physical/emotional/mental characteristics, but when it
comes down to it, we use names, and well.

So there's nothing wrong with a list of printer names. They work. There's
also no requirement that you list all the printers in your organization in a
flat hierarchy.

*You* might not care which Janet you go out with, but personally I prefer
the Janet who is 5'4", 110 lbs, blond hair, blue eyes, and drives a Honda.

AND YOU ARE TO STAY AWAY FROM HER!!!  :)

There are some awfully confused men out there then, if the cannot tell

I know dozens of dance partners whom I recognize (and ask to dance)
based on what they look like and how they dance.  If I remember their
names, so much the better.

("why didn't you ask her to dance?"  "I didn't know her name!")

But when you look her up, I'll be it's by name, and I'll bet you call her
Janet not "human woman, 5'4"..."

The important thing is that because humans deal with the fuzzy logic behind
the name, the name doesn't *have* to be so detailed. And it works. Even if
you know multiple Janets, I doubt you get them confused. (you better not ;-)

Even then, you still (most likely) do it based on a very few conscious
parameters.

This brings up an interesting issue.
Today we have one DNS search list for host names.

But as a user, if I use DNS for discovering services, it isn't
clear that I want the same search list for each service. 
For instance, when looking for a printer I probably want a searchlist
based on physical location e.g.
	floor1.building2.example.com floor2.building2.example.com

but when looking for a file server I might only care about 
organizational aspects i.e. have a searchlist of
	myorg.eng.example.com

Doesn't this imply a different search list per service?

One could of course say that such complexity indicates that the network is
"large" hence administered hence a different mechanism (web pages listing
printers etc) should be used. But I think assuming such a discountinuity 
as architecturally desired is a bad idea; even large companies with 
administrators want to minimize the cost of administering the network. 
Forcing
a large discountinuity when going from a "small" to a "large" network
seems counter to this. Compare this with the SLP approach where a "large" 
network implies introducing DAs but not doing service discovery in a 
completely
different fashion - that discontinuity is much much smaller.

The discontinuity issue is IMHO an indication that we don't yet agree
on the constraints for the problem we are trying to solve for service
discovery.

Actually, I think some valid points were raised, but it's probably best to
take the discussion to the forums that can actually deal with the issues
in depth.

The X is actually in a surprising position in the domain name:

   X._telnet._tcp.example.com

Creative use of PTR records allows the set of Xes to be discovered.
Multiple PTRs are returned for _service._proto.domain.name and
displayed in a box.  The user chooses something, a query is
then made for a SRV and the connection established.

http://files.dns-sd.org/draft-cheshire-dnsext-nias.txt, Section 10
has an example.

I have done a lot of work with appletalk (including implementing all the
bits that are relevant here).   It isn't too hard to implement (localtalk
aside, but that's not relevant) it is horrible to maintain (ever tried to
change a zone name?).

But none of that really matters, what's easy to implement or maintain
has little effect on what becomes popular (believe that web browsers are
easy ??)

  | more complex ones is a PITA from the other side, and jacks up network
  | traffic.

I think that you're putting too many assumptions on the user interface and
the protocol being closely linked.   They need not be.   Take a trivial
example - if you just looked at SMTP, and told people that's how e-mail
was to be sent, most of them wouldn't want to know.   And they needn't,
their mailer takes care of all of the detail, all the user needs to know
is how to stick in a To address, type the message, and send it.

The same is true here.   If you believe that a browser that simply lists
the names of available printers is the user interface that people want,
then I can trivially see how to make that work using SLP, I can't even
begin to imagine how to do it using (conventional) DNS.   (On the other
hand, if I already know the name of the printer I want, then DNS is
clearly the superior way to find out its address to talk to it).

On the other hand, if you want the browser to be smarter - when you're in
your graphics application, and select "print" (or "page setup" or something)
you get to see only the list of printers that can actually be used by
that application, as when it did its query, it was more selective than
just any printer - then it sounds much more like SLP to me.

Just because appletalk doesn't allow applications to assist like that,
and windows has no rational interface at all, so users aren't used to
this kind of help, doesn't mean that they're not going to like it when
it can be implemented.

  | need.

Sure, once you know who/what you want to talk to, names (labels) as a
reference work just fine.   But then we're beyond service location, the
service has already been located sometime in the past.   No objections at
all to remembering the name that resulted from a previous activation of
service location, and then using the DNS to find its address, over and
over again.

But somehow, we have to find Stuart initially, and when I start, all I
know is that I'm looking for a WG chair, who happens to be involved
with the zeroconf WG ...

How?

In the answer, don't assume there are necessarily any humans involved.
In much of this, there will be zero of those arcane animals.   Just nice
clean silicon life forms...

  | Seriously, names are what humans use.

The protocols designed here have to work for humans, they also have to
work without humans.   They have to work for small networks, but they
have to also keep working (or somehow know how to transition) when they're
on large networks (my laptop sometimes connects to my home net, which is
pretty small, and sometimes to the internet, which is pretty large, and
sometimes even to both at once...   the software in it doesn't change
when that happens, the same set has to cope with all possibilities).

  | So there's nothing wrong with a list of printer names. They work.

Not very well.   That's the environment I am used to, and I can never
figure out just which printer is which - yet they have names that people
believe will help - a few of them are obvious, most might mean something
to some people, I suppose, but they mean nothing to me.  I know which
printer I normally use, that's fine - but when that's not working, I have
to pick another one, and at that point it really starts getting hard.
Our list of names supposedly tells me where to go to find the printer,
that helps, assuming I know the geography and number scheme of the building
(which I don't, despite having occupied it since it was built, nearly a
decade ago).  It doesn't tell me which are inside rooms that have been
locked, and I can't get to (nor would SLP of course...).  It tells me
nothing about which printer will do what.   It all boils down to guesswork.

I suppose I could call the support staff - but then I'd end up talking to
myself.  I might find someone who actually knows what some of the printers
can do, but I doubt I can find anyone who knows about all of them.  If only
I could just ask the printers...

  | There's also no requirement that you list all the printers in your
  | organization in a flat hierarchy. 

No, of course not, and we don't, and printers in other departments are
all nicely hidden in general.  But hierarchy for no better reason than
making the list smaller is hopeless, it makes things harder, not easier.

But is every printer *required* to have a "name=xxx" attribute?

Is every printer required to check that its name is unique, and take some 
action if it is not?

It is fine to talk about what things can be done with this or that 
protocol, but it is hard to write a client that takes advantage of a 
feature unless you know that *ALL* implementers of that protocol will 
implement the feature you are depending upon.

The recipe for an interoperable protocol is a small list of mandatory 
features, and an even smaller list of optional features.

Really?

Several thousand devices?

Can you back this up with a real example?

I can imagine owning ten or twenty hi-fi components, but not several 
thousand.

I use X10 light switches in my house, but I don't have more than twenty 
or thirty of those.

The cheapest object I think I own is a pencil, but even for something 
that cheap I can't see any reason to own several thousand pencils. I have 
a hard time thinking of any object of which I own several thousand. If I 
do need to own several thousand network devices, that seems like a strong 
argument to make them as cheap and simple as possible.

Only if the application developer can safely assume that every printer 
has a unique name. As long as the name is allowed to be optional (or 
'unknown') the application developer has to think of some other way to 
reliably record the identity of the user's chosen default printer.

Are all printers *required* to do this? If not, then an application

much use.

Sure, anyone *could* do anything, but *do* all printers have friendly

printing software that works will all printers (the whole point of open 
standards, after all) what can I rely on to be implemented by *every* 
printer? Anything optional can't be safely assumed, so for practial 
purposes it may as well not be in the spec at all.

Right. And if you are worrying that doing queries for five different 
protocols like this is horribly inefficient, I should let you know that 
Apple's Rendezvous software packs all five queries into a single UDP 
packet. Those of you on this list who already have OS X 10.2 will be able 
to see this using a packet sniffer.

>Then you can map whatever services are offered, and search through the

>Is this the intended approach?

Right. For example, the AFP protocol allows server-side searching. When 
you press Cmd-F in the Finder and search for files by name, size, date, 
etc., the search is not performed locally. A query description is sent to 
the server, executed on the server, and then the results are sent back. 
My belief is that complex queries like this will always be 
protocol-specific. The kinds of queries a file server has to answer are 
different to the kinds of queries a printer has to answer, and different 
to the kinds of queries a database engine has to answer. It is reasonable 
to expect each application protocol to support the appropriate query 
sematics for that application. I believe that it is unreasonable to 
expect a generic service discovery protocol to implement sufficient query 
sematics to cover all those cases -- especially when you also want a $49 
ink-jet printer to implement that service discovery protocol.

Can we delete the word "mini" from all this discussion?

A DNS server is a DNS server.

I used the term "mini-DNS server" in my original posting to refer to code 
size and complexity, not protocol and behaviour. Now everyone is acting 
as if a mini-DNS server behaves differently than a normal DNS server. It 
doesn't. The only difference is that the DNS server embedded in your $99 
home gateway doesn't have to be as sophisticated as BIND 9, because no 
one is expecting to buy a $99 home gateway and use it as the 
authoritative server for -- to pick an example -- the entire "com." 
domain.

In all past and future references to "mini-DNS", please ignore the word 
"mini". Any assertions that, "Mini-DNS doesn't work because of x," should 
be read as saying equally that, "DNS doesn't work because of x." They are 
the same thing, and I'm sorry I caused this confusion.

>You're again bringing this back to the human aspect of "choosing"
>things.  For software agents to search and select services attribute

I never said that attributes weren't important.

What I questioned is whether you want to ship some generic query 
description over the network and have every device interpret the query 
itself, or whether you want get all the information from the devices, and 
then perform your evaluation locally to determine which one (or ones) 
meet your needs.

Those who are old enough will remember the battle between 
ISDN-to-the-desktop and Ethernet.

The ISDN proponents said that the network should be very carefully 
managed, and should never lose a single byte of data. Of course that made 
ISDN switching hardware very slow and expensive compared to an Ethernet 
hub.

The Ethernet vendors said, "Forget call setup. Forget reservations. 
Forget virtual circuits. Just make the hardware so cheap and fast that no 
one cares."

The market spoke. People would rather have fast and cheap. People would 
rather have an uncertain share of 10Mb/s (or 100Mb/s, or Gb/s) than a 
guaranteed 100% of 64kb/s (that's 0.06Mb/s, for anyone who's counting).

I take the same approach here -- I'd rather focus my efforts on making 
the network fast and cheap, and fill it with cheap simple devices, than 
focus my efforts on making complicated devices that have to execute 
generic queries locally in order to preserve the precious bandwidth of my 
slow network.

To state it even more plainly: If a device vendor selling a $50 device 
has a limited budget to spend on either a faster network interface, or on 
a faster processor to execute a more complicated protocol, I'd rather 
have a simple device with a 10Mb/s interface, instead of a more powerful 
device with only a 1Mb/s interface.

Err. Did I miss something here? The SLP protocol now requires every 
device to implement the Soundex name matching algorithm to find variant 
spellings of names?

If SLP *does* require Soundex name matching, then that's pretty good 
evidence for my claim that SLP is too much burden to impose on every 
device.

If SLP does *not* require Soundex name matching, then that's pretty good 
evidence for my claim that SLP's query language is not sufficiently 
general to meet the needs of every application.

Either way, the conclusion is the same -- one size does not fit all. 
Let's strip the discovery protocol to the lowest practical common 
denominator, and let each application implement the attribute matching 
technique appropriate to that application.

Agreed. I've thought of proposing a DHCP announcement packet that is sent 
when a DHCP server comes on-line, which would let the clients reconfigure 
immediately and reduce this delay, but we have so much struggle getting 
agreement on even the simplest things that I don't have the energy to be 
taking on more work right now.

That is true. We could implement multiple different domains of services.

For any protocol I think we can think of ways to make it arbitrarily 
complicated and configurable, but we have to exercise judgement in 
deciding when all the complication serves enough purpose to justify the 
cost. If it is so complicated that it is never implemented, then it is 
hard to argue that the benefit was worth it.

I disagree.

SLP has one discontinuity when going from a small LAN with no scopes 
(i.e. scope "DEFAULT") to a medium-sized network with multiple scopes. 
How does the user find out in which scope they should be looking for 
printers? What I proposed with mDNS-SD is no different.

SLP has another discontinuity when going from a medium-sized network 
(e.g. one corporation) to a larger network (e.g. the whole Internet). It 
just stops working. How would you, Erik Nordmark at Sun, use SLP (not 
DNS) to find the list of public time servers provided by some other 
company, say Apple?

In contrast, the example I gave before, to enumerate my printers using 
DNS-SD, will work from anywhere on this planet that has working Internet 
connectivity:

nslookup -q=ptr _printer._tcp.stuartcheshire.org.

Are you asking about AppleTalk or DNS-SD?

Over AppleTalk, once the printer has been discovered using NBP, the 
driver talks to it using PostScript queries over PAP (the AppleTalk 
Printer Access Protocol) to find out more about its capabilities.

Using DNS-SD, the printer's TXT record contains some rudimentary 
information to identify simple capabilities, like whether it can print 
colour. This can save a subsequent connection to the printer to 
interrogate it directly.

However, and I have said this before, no attribute list can meet every 
application's requirements. Sure, the printer can print colour, but is it 
four-colour or six-colour? What is the ink chemistry? What is the gamut? 
What is the colour matching profile?

This is not a contrived example. At Stanford we had a high-speed 
black-and-white Xerox printer that could also overlay red toner. It was 
good for doing titles in red, and figures like pie charts, but useless 
for printing a full-colour photograph. If you are looking for a list of 
printers on the network that can print colour, should this printer show 
up or not? It's not a binary yes-or-no answer is it? It depends on what 
the user wants to print on it.

Far easier than changing a windows domain name, and I have yet to feel
confident that I have read any sort of SLP manual correctly...it seems to
work anyway, but I don't want that type of result. Knowing it worked because
I did the right things, that is what I want

Compared to other things, yes, from the human view.

Right...but email does a lot more than what we are talking about. I'm
talking about getting a list of a specific type of thing.

Maybe you can, but since there are no good SLP tools out there, from the IT
viewpoint, SLP is just a big PITA. DNS has good tools, and is well
understood.

But that can be accomplished via the printer information on the local
machine. That's what PPDs, and intelligent print protocols are for. That
way, all the 'intelligent settings' are done locally. I don't want a network
full of packets fully describing the complete capabilities of a Xerox
1235DX. Just tell me the name of the printer, give my Mac the data it needs
to auto select the right ppd, or tell me I need the right ppd, and be done
with it. There is no need to query the printer for that information.

In my experience, people using computers are inundated with information.
They want less information to deal with. If I have to wade through a list of
options just to pick a printer, then why bother with SLP, or IPP? Just go
back to LPR, and manually set everything.

Right. So then you just want a list of WG chairs in the zeroconf zone.

The best way that people know how...you ask the people who set up the
printers.

See...that's your prime error. Let's design a protocol without considering
the humans. Well, you *can't* assume there are no humans. In fact, it's one
of the few things you can count on, that there will be humans. Because if
the humans can't use and implement your protocol easily, they won't use it.

Right...but the simpler you keep things, the better they will work. That's
the closest thing to a universal truth I know.

But in your example, there is no amount of complex device queries that would
help you either. Sometimes, the humans need to use better names, but that
can get out of hand as well. In any case, the traffic generated by what is
not an outrageous possible device feature browser query would get really
large, really quick. That's a bad thing.

But then you just admitted you really don't know where they all are...so
what good will knowing the features do you if you don't know where the paper
is coming out at? So your really large amount of network traffic to receive
every feature from every printer in the building still won't do you much
good. You'd be better off knowing that the printers on your list are all
near you, and them looking at the ppd options for that printer to see if
it's the one you want. You don't need a complex protocol for that.

In my experience, it's a driving reason to use a proper hierarchy. To reduce
useless input.

Soo...  seems to me that a complete specification would need to
have templates for the TXT records along the lines that SLP has
schemas.  Or do you have something else in mind?

You just root the SLP DAs within the DNS, so that you can  reach the SLP
DAs for a given domain. This is described in the following draft:

Stuart,
I can't remember who wrote the original note you are replying to, but I sometimes stagecrew for amateur theatre groups.  We often have only a few hours on a Sunday afternoon to completely rig a theatre for a show (let in at 12, with a rehearsal at 6 or 7pm).  In that time, as well as all of the scenery having to be placed, an entire lighting rig needs to be installed and positioned.  Currently, only part of the rig is networked - usually using DMX, but increasingly 10base-T is appearing for the more complex effects units.

A typical rig for a show in a 150 seat theatre will probably involve about 80 lamps, each with colour scrollers.  To avoid ladder or tower climbing, remote positioners would be nice (we can't afford to hire them yet....).  This comes to 240 devices which have to be installed, configured and tested in 6 hours.  When you start to look at the scale of the large touring rigs for rock bands, several thousand devices in one venue is not unthinkable.

Really?

Several thousand devices?

Can you back this up with a real example?

I can imagine owning ten or twenty hi-fi components, but not several 
thousand.

I use X10 light switches in my house, but I don't have more than twenty 
or thirty of those.

The cheapest object I think I own is a pencil, but even for something 
that cheap I can't see any reason to own several thousand pencils. I have 
a hard time thinking of any object of which I own several thousand. If I 
do need to own several thousand network devices, that seems like a strong 
argument to make them as cheap and simple as possible.

Yes, if you require this in the service template. And only a service template 
allows you to use a service type like "service:printer".

No. You may be able to require this in the service template, but the 
check+register action will not be atomic. 

But I dont think that it is good idea: You don't make things easier when one 
printer is called "Epson Stylus 900n" and the other one "Epson Stylus 900n 
#2". And if you turn both off and on again they may even swap their names, so 
the names are not even stable. 
Saving the printer's name in persistent memory will create other problems, so 
people could wonder why one model is called Epson Stylus 900n #3" even though 
there is only one printer in the network. And what happens if you put a 
printer that has previously been number #2 in a network that already has two 
printers of the type? 

A better solution is to add a unique/serial/random number to the URL or 
attributes so you get a persistent identifier for the printers, e.g.  
"service:printer:http://169.254.17.202;(name=Epson Stylus 
900n),(serialno=65465421)".

No, but it allows wildcards. So if I dont know how to spell your name I could 
search for "Stuar*" or "Ches*". 
It would be easy to use Soundex with SLP though: just store the Soundex code 
in the attribute.

No one said that SLP's attribute queries are sufficient for all applications. 
But they should be sufficient for most, and help you to get a much better 
performance in large networks.

I am new to this list so forgive the newby question, but I would like to know if DNS-SRV [RFC2782] is under consideration as the service discovery mechanism for the Zeroconf initiative.

Martin,

I can back up your story for Stuart since I have done many large scale
entertainment projects, mostly using Ethernet to provide communications
using our Ethernet control units between consoles and lighting equipment.

I have done projects with up to 10000 lighting channels, however this
doesn't mean you need 10000 IP addresses. Lighting channels are normally
bundled in dimmer packs and moving lights etc. So the real demand in terms
of addressing capabilities is probably closer to less than 2000 in my
example.

Using AppleTalk over Ethernet we had systems like this set up in a very
short time with virtually no network configuration time.

Fortunately, zeroconf will allow us to do similar things based on IP.

There is no 'zeroconf initiative.'  The zeroconf working group is
chartered to produce two documents.  One is on the requirements
for zeroconf networking, the other is on IPv4 link local address
autoconfiguration.  Once these documents are published, the working
group will have fulfilled its charter, I believe.

The charter of this working group is to work on the problem of:

* making IP networking work...
* with zero user configuration and...
* zero dependence on external infrastructure to provide configuration.

If someone wishes to make a brief observation that achieving this goal 
would allow us to retire AppleTalk (and that would be a good thing), then 
that is acceptable.

However, protracted in-depth arguments about how easy (or hard) it may be 
(or may not be) to run a large AppleTalk network are out of scope for 
this list. This is not the "Bash AppleTalk Working Group" (or the 
"Support AppleTalk Working Group"). This Working Group has nothing to do 
with AppleTalk, except inasmuch as if we are successful, then people may 
not need to keep using AppleTalk much longer.

Percisely. This is what I wrote in "Discovering Named Instances of 
Abstract Services using DNS":

<http://files.dns-sd.org/draft-cheshire-dnsext-nias.txt>

   Some services discovered via Service Instance Enumeration may need
   more than just an IP address and port number ...
   In these cases, the necessary additional data is stored in a TXT
   record with the same name as the SRV record. The specific nature of
   that additional data, and how it is to be used, is service-dependent.

And, in section 6 "Selective Queries":

   The list of possible subtypes, if any, and the additional data stored
   in TXT records, if any, are defined separately for each basic service
   type.

Forgive me if I laugh, but let me quote from the introduction of that 
document:

1. Introduction

   DNS SRV [2] provides a convenient way for a UA
   to discover the SLP service

Isn't that what I've been arguing all along? DNS SRV (as described in 
NIAS) provides a convenient way to discover any service.

If you need to use DNS SRV to discover the service discovery server, why 
not just skip the middleman and use DNS SRV to discover the service 
you're actually looking for?

The crux of the debate between SLP and DNS-SD is the assertion that you 
need a complicated attribute-query-based service discovery protocol, 
because a simple protocol couldn't work in a network this large.

So, the question is this:

  Could a simple protocol work on a network with 240 devices, or more?

Perhaps we can find existing operational experience by looking at what 
people did using the old AppleTalk Name Binding Protocol, a very 
simple-minded protocol.

Over to you, Tony:

>I have done projects with up to 10000 lighting channels, however
>this doesn't mean you need 10000 IP addresses. Lighting channels
>are normally bundled in dimmer packs and moving lights etc. So the
>real demand in terms of addressing capabilities is probably closer
>to less than 2000 in my example.
>
>Using AppleTalk over Ethernet we had systems like this set up in
>a very short time with virtually no network configuration time.

If something as exceedingly simple-minded and inefficient as AppleTalk 
NBP worked for Tony de Rijk in this environment, we need to look 
elsewhere for evidence that a complicated attribute-query-based service 
discovery protocol is worth the cost.

The IETF is an organization populated by individuals who come together to 
work on protocol design.

This members of this Working Group, Zeroconf, working together, 
identified "discovery of services available on the network" as one of the 
basic requirements for Zeroconf networking.

In my capacity as an individual contributor, not as co-chairman of the 
group, I made an individual submission proposing what I believe is the 
best way to meet that requirement:

<http://files.dns-sd.org/draft-cheshire-dnsext-nias.txt>

At the present time this document is an individual submission, not a 
product of the Working Group as a whole.

While we're talking about DNS-SD, this is a good opportunity to correct a 
misconception that some people seem to have.

Some people seem to believe that Apple is not allowed to ship products 
using DNS-SD until the IETF has approved it. This is false.

Apple, or any other company, is allowed to ship products using whatever 
networking protocols they choose.

AppleTalk is an example of a protocol that Apple shipped and continues to 
ship without seeking any outside permission or approval. The AppleShare 
IP file sharing protocol is another protocol that Apple shipped and 
continues to ship without seeking any outside permission or approval. 
Microsoft and other companies do the same all the time.

What is different in this case is that Apple is willing to share this 
protocol with the IETF. Of course Apple has patents to protect its 
intellectual property, but I am working with Apple's lawyers on getting 
an IPR statement offering a royalty-free license to those patents for the 
purpose of implementing this specification. If members of the IETF want 
to contribute to make this an open protocol, then Apple is willing to do 
that. If no one in the IETF cares about this, then Apple will continue to 
ship it, and it will be just like UPnP or FireWire or Bluetooth or USB or 
any of a countless list of other protocols that companies ship without 
any IETF involvement whatsoever.

I'd like to take this opportunity to conduct a little survey.

<http://files.dns-sd.org/draft-cheshire-dnsext-nias.txt>

How many people have read the draft and think it is a good idea?

How many people have read the draft and think it is a bad idea?

At this stage let's hold off on the arguments why --
right now I'm just looking for a one-line answer:
"I've read NIAS and I think it is good," or,
"I've read NIAS and I think it is bad."

I think I agree in principle, but disagree with choice of implementation:

NIAS promotes abuse of the TXT RR, which has been accepted
(abused?) by many as having no semantic definition and therefore used
in non-standard ways across many installations. 

If you're lucky then at least people might adopt style similar to that
suggested in experimental RFC1464 (i.e. lots of 'IN TXT "attr=val"'
entries for a single domain name), but then we're back to the game of
"which ontology for attribute names does this definition belong to?"

Just because an RR exists and its use accepted as being
non-standardised doesn't mean that a later standard can come along and
blat all over everyone else's (legitimate) use of the RR.

*blush* - we abuse it by tieing registrar/warranty information
etc. against domain names - stuff that isn't sensitive and therefore no
problem if its public, but stuff for which there is no schema or ontology
defining a syntax of use and no more convenient location to store it.

Without creating yet another RR for service attributes within the DNS
(and I'm not suggesting this!), I don't see how NIAS can reliably scale
across sites.


Maybe I've missed this being covered in an earlier thread. If so, shout
at me and direct me to the nearest archive. Thanks ;-)

It provides a way to discover some services with various limitations.

Finding the service discovery service allows you to send complex
queries.  We are at loggerheads here, Stuart.  Some argue for the
utility of complex queries, others argue against their importance.
I suggest we discontinue this largely esthetic debate.

I disagree that the SLP protocol is complicated.  We're back to esthetics.

There is more to it than this.  If you do not have attribute based 
queries, each service has to handle server feature discovery.  So,
by making the service discovery simpler you make applications more
complex.

Stuart,

I read it (fast) and I think the idea of using DNS for discovery in ad-hoc
networks is good. I've argued for that two years ago on the UPnP mailing
list. Back then it was about SSDP vs. mDNS. It is useful for simple devices
in simple networks to talk a single protocol for both name resolution and
service discovery.

About how the document suggests DNS can be used for discovery, at this time
I can only say that it may be a good start for discussion. Holding off the
arguments, I will only mention that the idea of defining labels for services
attributes (e.g. _postscript) I don't think it's going to fly. If we are to
use DNS for service discovery I think we should give up the hope of doing
queries by attributes (other than the service name itself).

I agree that an explicit "attribute list" RR type would be good, but 
there is such opposition to creating any new DNS RR types that if you 
want to ship a product this decade, the only way to do it is with an 
existing type.

I am willing to be proved wrong on this. If NIAS were to be adopted as an 
IETF document, and DNSEXT were to prove willing to create a new RR type 
to better support it, then Apple would find a way to do a 
backwards-compatible migration over to the new standard.

So what is a "service name"? Is it "printer" or something more specific
like "lpr" or "ipp" (which actually name the the protocol used to communicate
to the service?)

I think this is fundamentally different shades of grey.
You could have
	_printer._tcp.<yourdomain>
and an adjunct protocol for discovering the capabilities of the printer
(including the protocols used to send print jobs).

A slightly different shade of grey is to use
	_slp._udp.<yourdomain>
and use the SLP protocol for discovering the capabilities of the printer
(including the protocols used to send print jobs).
In this case the "printer" specific protocol is replaced by an SLP service
template, which describes the attributes.
The difference between "define a service template per service"
or "define a service capability protocol per service" doesn't seem
significant to me - the hard part is figuring out what the standard and
optional capabilities are for a given service.


A different shade (in the other direction) is to use
	_lpr._tcp.<yourdomain>
and
	_ipp._tcp.<yourdomain>
and use lpr/ipp specific ways to discover the capabilities (but not
the protocol used to send the print jobs since that's implicit in the tag).
If there services which support many different protocols this seems
like more work than the above to shades of grey.

I agree. That's exactly why I said that we can only start talking about that
at this time; we must decide where to stop. That would depend on the
zeroconf requirements for service discovery; which I don't think provide
that level of detail yet.

If zeroconf is nothing more than a migration of AppleTalk and NetBIOS
(including the MS Browser), than "printer" is enough.

If zeroconf needs to take into account the IETF-documented printing
protocols, then "ipp"/"lpr" is enough.

If zeroconf does not imply losing any capabilities available in managed
networks (i.e. what SLP can do) then we need SLP.

From what I've heard so far, my impression is that zeroconf means more than
the possibility to function when there is no centralized configuration.
Besides that, it seems that we're also looking for a suite of protocols that
can be easily implemented by simple devices.

Yes, all these are possible. 

It seems like nobody here wants to start from the scratch with the user
requirements. Everybody has one protocol in mind that they've used, they
liked it and now think we should simply mimic it. In UPnP's case, when I
proposed to use mDNS instead of SSDP, it wasn't because DNS is appropriate
for service discovery in general. It was only because the UPnP service
discovery requirements could have been easily achieved with DNS (already
required for name resolution).

So what are the zeroconf requirements for service discovery? Nothing more
than AppleTalk/MS Browser, a lot more (like SLP/LDAP) or somewhere in
between? Once we know that it will be easy to decide if DNS is appropriate
or not.

Hello Stuart,

I've been passively monitoring the discussion, and it
seems to me that people are taking technical positions
based on preconceptions about SLP that aren't necessary.
My information about SLP is based on my involvement from
some years ago, but I think it is still relevant.

1) It should be possible to write a SLP service
   agent VERY cheaply.  The DA is more complicated,
   but not needed for zeroconf.

2) The harder part would be to make all aspects of the
   service operation user-configurable, but that isn't
   so hard anyway because the schema are machine parsable
   (on purpose) so one could even write a general purpose
   SLP configurator that would work for all devices.
   At least that was the original intention.  I don't
   know how that has carried forward.

3) If SLP isn't simple enough, then it would have been
   very nice for the people who wanted simplicity to
   say so in the working group meeting.  I was among
   those people, and I thought it ended up "pretty
   simple", but I might have been wrong.  Plus, it can
   still be fixed, just like with everything that
   hasn't taken the universe by storm yet.

4) I get the feeling that some people who are not
   enthusiastic about SLP take the position that
   "if it's not DNS, it's broken".  And yet DNS experts
   say that we shouldn't be overloading DNS.  Doesn't
   that mean we shouldn't be adding stuff to DNS for
   which it wasn't designed?

5) To require that the user be the chooser interactively,
   completely disenfranchises non-interactive applications
   and the huge world of embedded computing which should
   be an integral part of zeroconf or else somebody didn't
   tell me that humans have to always be part of the loop.

6) SLP was specifically designed so that the same
   equipment could be moved between home and office
   without reconfiguration, or so that a small office
   could grow into a large office without configuration.
   In other words, it offers a smooth upgrade path without
   requirement for reconfiguring individual devices.
   That does NOT mean that a zeroconf user has to be as
   smart as a network administrator.  Instead, it means
   that SLP was intended to be suitable for both, without
   burdening the users.  This prevents the horrid scenario
   of having to decide whether to build and stock an "office"
   printer or a "home" printer -- and prevents the problem
   of having people having to figure out which variety they
   want to buy.

Your further comments will be appreciated.

Regards,
Charlie P.

I believe the intent is to use the service names IANA uses in their 
list of assigned ports. lpr's service name is printer. ipp's serivce 
name is ipp. So a printer supporting both ipp and lpr would register 
_printer._tcp.<domain>. and _ipp._tcp.<domain>.. Registering as just 
_printer._tcp.<domain>. would not work because there are actually two 
protocols running on two different ports. Part of the information 
returned about a service is the port it is running on. In cases where 
the port is not enough to distinguish between two services on the same 
machine, such as the case of lpr where a print queue is also necessary, 
the TXT record is used to specify the additional information. As noted 
before, such information would be protocol specific. Most protocols do 
not need additional information.

And, BTW, you can get a free and portable implementation with a BSD-like 
license from www.openslp.org. So in most cases you don't even have to 
implement it yourself (unless your device's OS has a API that is very 
different from Posix or Win32).

SLP is a good idea. But it has yet to see an implementation that isn't too
hard or too obtuse to set up. There are a lot of good ideas that die when
you actually have to set them up. It's also trying to do too much, from what
I've seen. There is a temptation to make things be able to handle every
single situation they might encounter. This is understandable, yet quite
bad. It ends up complicating things into unusabiliity, and they get dumped
in the wastebin.

As an historical reference, read up on the history of the F-111 aircraft.

The notes I saw indicated that you were assigning SLP to the wastebin.
Would you prefer an implementation that's simple to use, or would
you prefer to trash SLP and do something else?

Whatever else you choose, you don't have any automatic guarantee
that it will be implemented in a way that's easy to use.   Maybe
it would be better to lobby for SLP implementations that are very
easy to use.

I'm suggesting that SLP as a protocol was designed to offer ease
of use and flexibility across a range of deployment possibilities,
specifically including zeroconf.  People who want to sell other
products will contend otherwise.

The desirable protocol would allow very simple implementations to work
for very simple scenarios, coexisting with other more fully featured
implementations (i.e., without conflicts that limit usability).

I get the point (F-111  :=   "bad stuff"), presumably because of
the creeping feature creature.  That's not relevant to this discussion
unless there are ways to pull a string and watch very simple F-111's
fall out.

I would have preferred that the problems of implementation and maintenance
of SLP been given equal weight along with the capabilities. From what I have
seen, that wasn't the case.

*In general*, the simpler something is, the more reliable it is, and the
easier it is to implement. It is much harder to take something complex and
make it simple.

I'm not selling anything. If I had seen any implementation of SLP that was
easy to install, easy to configure, and worked well across platforms, I'd be
using it everywhere. But I haven't, and I'm not.

And a simple implementation of SLP that I can install today across five
platforms exists where?

No, actually. The F-111 was designed to be the one size fits all aircraft.
Robert McNamara and a lot of other very smart people with many smart
initials after their names decided to build one plane that could be all
things to all people. Carrier landings, air superiority, ground attack,
medium range bombing, strategic bombing, making pancakes, washing
dishes...it ended up being a medium range bomber, and an electronic
countermeasures platform, and is generally considered one of the best
examples of what happens when you try to make one thing handle all
conditions. So, in the end, they *did* pull a string, and got a simple F-111
that did one or two things very well.

If you thought the F-111 was bad for that reason, 
you must really dislike the Joint Strike Fighter!

But, from my perspective when I was involved with some of the
protocol specification, it was a strong consideration.  We tried
to work through a lot of scenarios, especially how an installation
might transition gracefully from "scopeless" to multiple scopes.
I thought we had done a passable job of it.

Regarding the implementation, I guess there are some freeware
things, but I have not kept up with it and have to defer to
others on this point.

Exactly.  Which is why it should be possible to take SLP and
implement a restricted, but simple, subset of it for some service
agents and some user agents where simplicity is the priority.
These simpler implementations are supposed to still be able
to be responsible citizens on the same networks that also
support more complicated SLP implementations, and should still
get the service resolutions they need.

For instance, I believe it is the case that a user agent can
request a printer without any attributes, and it will get a
list of printers.  That information could easily be supplied
to an interactive "chooser" program.

A service agent could be provided with hardcoded attributes
(avoiding configuration requirements) but still by protocol
is quite able to answer user requests.

If you want simplicity, SLP is supposed to be able to provide it.

> And a simple implementation of SLP that I can install today across five
> platforms exists where?

Here, I am totally unable to be of assistance.  I did see that
someone else has something to offer, but maybe it doesn't run
on five platforms.

I should, however, point out the tendency to see the grass as greener
on the other side of the hill.  If SLP doesn't run on 5 platforms,
then you can easily suggest and imagine that XXXFOOprotocol would
of course in the future run on 5 platforms and besides that be
better and more scalable and cheaper than SLP.  By the time the
future rolls around, maybe XXXFOOprotocol would have a few warts
that make it smell bad, and SLP would run on 7 platforms.

You just don't know until you have the results.  Just like you
just don't know that XXXFOOprotocol is better than SLP until
you see the specs.  There are specs on how to instrument DNS
to do part of the job.  It remains to be seen whether those are
better, but for reasons to be skeptical I refer you to my previous
note.

But that means that every particular plane has to have all the features.
Not every implementation of SLP has to have all the optional features
that are defined in the protocol specification document.  This is
exactly because quite a few people (including myself) did not want
to mandate implementation of all those features.  As I remember, even
the scoping is optional, as would be appropriate for zeroconf
deployments.

I am sure this misperception is why you are disappointed by SLP,
but the fact remains that SLP implementations do not have to
implement all the complex features.  My understanding of the
desirable result is that simple things are simple, complex things
are possible for those units incorporating the desired functionality,
and that all of them should be able to gainfully coexist in a
mutually constructive network environment.

This is better than requiring the units to implement multiple
independent protocols to do almost the same thing.

Charlie P.

Actually, they had a good idea, but the implementation was garbage, and the
entire concept of commonality got a really bad name because of that bad
implementation.

The JSF seems to be a much better implementation, but then, there are a lot
of differences between the different implementations of the JSF, which shows
flexibility and foresight.

This is something that I see time and time again in the computer field.
Brilliant idea, but the implementations are so execrably bad that the entire
idea is discredited, and worse yet, the entire concept gets a bad name even
though there is a lot of good in the concept.

example:  The Network Computer. It was and is a good idea for business. But
because some nimrod CEO, <cough>Larry Ellison</cough> through out a
idiotically low, (for the time) price, and no one gave a thought to
infrastructure costs, the entire concept got a really bad name.

example: The Newton. Fantastic idea in so many ways. The initial
implementations were so bad that we are now stuck with *graffiti* which
forces you to write in a different language in an unnatural fashion with a
bit of plastic that a two year old would find small.

You can have the greatest answer to something the world will ever see, and f
the implementations are bad, it won't be used at all.

I've not seen much, and the information is not the easiest thing in the
world to find. (one rule of thumb...if it doesn't have an O'Reilly book, IT
people tend not to want to use it)

But now you're talking about what will become two different things...SLP and
liteSLP...and how do you coordinate one with the other when you don't have
control over which is which? If you go with an implementation that needs
item 'foo', and then you have to integrate something that doesn't, and never
will include item foo...

That may be...but configuring SLP is still voodoo, and not that many
networking setups use it at all.

But when you take something with X number of features, if X is a large
number, then you quickly get into implementation incompatibilities, and the
whole thing goes straight in the toilet. This almost happened with Kerberos.

Well, that works very well...you don't use one single protocol for all your
networking use. You use multiple protocols, because each one does some
things better than others.

Not.  The implementations that implement optional features still
have to be able to interact with implementations that do not
implement those features, or else your protocol design is
broken.  Furthermore, negotiation should not be necessary.

It should be the case the SLP can be used without configuration.

Cool!  No problem! ... but what about configuring the records?
What about making sure that equipments agree on the format of
the data?  Maybe there are some other specification documents?
Doesn't matter about administration?  What about those cool
user interface programs for inserting records when you plug
the equipment in?

I would say that your answer was far from satisfactory, and wasn't
relevant to my example...

Not if they follow protocol.

This is way too glib.  Surely I didn't suggest using a single network
protocol for all uses.  I meant to suggest that having two
protocols for managing service discovery means that implementations
have to have both of them, and then either try them in parallel,
or serialize, or whatever -- plus the user has to be twice as
smart about configuration for protocols that require configuration.

That's it for me!

But if the protocol isn't particularly useful without an optional 
feature, then the protocol is broken. The name property is an optional 
feature of SLP, right? If you want to store a service name to resolve 
later in case the IP address of a service changes, it can not be done 
for services that do not support the name property.

Um...I can almost guarantee this will happen...it already has...Microsoft
and Kerberos, Cisco wireless base stations. If you give someone a way to
lock you into their implementation of any standard, they will try to do just
that more often than not.

Only if you want more than link local. What about configuring different SLP
zones, DAs etc.?

What about getting people to use SLP at all beyond the limited Apple
implementation, and some HP printers? Where are the books on setting up SLP,
understanding the data formats? What about getting stuff that doesn't use
SLP at all to be advertised along with SLP - enabled apps?

As I learned in basic training..."If ifs and buts were fruits and nuts,
every day would be Christmas". I'm too much of a cynic to buy that a MS or a
Cisco won't pervert a protocol with as much wiggle room as SLP. In MS's
case, on the Windows side at least, that's a part of the mission statement
almost.

And having one overly engineered one almost guarantees that vendors will try
to lock you into their version of it. There's too much money to be made by
doing that to think otherwise.

I do not know any other implementations, but OpenSLP is very easy to install 
and works on Linux, BSD, Solaris, Tru64, HPUX, UnixWare and Win32, according 
to the FAQ. In a DA-less network, you just install it (via RPM, for example), 
and it work. Apps that use it should register their services automatically. 
If you need a DA, just edit /etc/slp.conf and set net.slp.isDA = true. Then 
your slp daemon is also a DA. If you need scopes, edit the variable 
net.slp.useScopes. Other implementations should be similar, as the config 
file format is specified in RFC 2614.
You can find the documentation here:
http://www.openslp.org/doc/html/UsersGuide/index.html

just what X Y and Z are) will be chartered to work on those.

I would kind of suspect that some form or service/server discovery mechanism
might be a useful requirement to have, as is likely to be some non DS kind of
name lookup mechanism (a zeroconf type of lookup).

Certainly true.   But "no-one has done this yet, so it must be a bad

It does more than some people need, and less that what others need.
There's a good chance that puts it about where it ought to be (note:
I had nothing at all to do with SLP when it was being defined, I just
ignored it as "someone else's problem", but having looked at what came
out of that effort, it looks to me to be about right).

There can be, SLP certainly doesn't do that.

  | As an historical reference, read up on the history of the F-111 aircraft.

I know this has already beaten to death, as irrelevant side point, but
Aust actually bought a bunch of those 20-30 years ago, when the US couldn't
figure out what to do with them.   At the time, the huge cost, and buying
cast off US planes that seemed to be wanted by no-one generated lots of
opposition.   Those planes are just being (about to be?) retired now/soon.
Last I heard (this isn't something I follow...) the one big problem was that
there was simply nothing available which could even come close to being an
adequate replacement.   For the US, where having a whole bunch of specialised
planes is possible, and makes sense, the F-111 might have been not as
wonderful as hoped, not being perfect at anything.   For Aust, where a couple
of dozen top class planes (or something, I have no idea) is all the air
force get to own (that is not counting trainers, cargo planes, ...) a
plane like the F-111, with all of its faults, turned out to be just perfect.

Back in the 70's, someone must have known that (it sure wasn't me).

I haven't read that draft, I find it too hard to keep up with ones
that are in the I-D directories.   I read what might be an earlier
version in the I-D directories.

If you seriously expect the WG to consider this, you really should take
the effort to keep it current (which means perhaps resubmitting it once
every 6 months if there are no changes happening).

  | How many people have read the draft and think it is a bad idea?

Assuming that nothing substantive has changed, that's me.   I sent private
mail in response to a private message saying why already...

Others here are also covering many of the same points, and more my reply
didn't get down to smaller details like abuse of TXT records, or name space 
pollution).

Not true.   There's no DNS on my net at home, there's no point configuring
anything so heavyweight for something so small.

I could set it up, but if I was doing that just for service discovery,
I'd prefer SLP I think, it should be easier.

Yes, you seem to have realised the point.   DNS does name to address 
translation (quite well) - name to anything translation (moderately well),
and discovery (of anything) very badly.

SLP on the other hand is designed for discovery, and name translation
very badly (though you could probably create a "name translation"
service if you were that deranged).

Each protocol does some things better than the other.

There's better info out there on DNS and its applications than SLP.

No, it means I liked the idea, but after six months of looking for a decent
way to implement this across a multiplatform network realized that this was
a good try that had been dumped out there without the people doing the
dumping spending the time to make it easy to implement.

I didn't say in every situation...but if it supports IP, it supports DNS.

But I can find all kinds of help and information on working with DNS...and
effectively nothing on SLP. Maybe if the people who create things spent more
time on implementing and maintaining those things, then they would have
created more howtos, effective documentation, and a way to easily implement
it across a network. I already have DNS, so using DNS in a new way is more
familiar, and easier to deal with. Dealing with SLP so far has been too much
of a PITA to be worth the effort, and there are not enough implementations
of it to make it worth the effort to have SLP on some things, and something
else on other things.

Even Apple, who was/is one of the biggest users of SLP has a pretty nasty
setup for it, and it doesn't exist at all in the print architecture. So on
that platform, it's only usable to find file servers. So the implementation
kinda stinks, although it's better than the windows implementation, which is
simply not there at all in 2000. So my majority platforms are only partially
covered. It's not running on my AIX boxen either. It may indeed be cool, and
in truth it is, but I've already seen better support for Zeroconf than I
have for SLP.

  | There's better info out there on DNS and its applications than SLP.

Sure, but not about abusing the DNS for doing searching.

The only thing that makes the proposed technique work incidentally, is
that this isn't what is being done.

The "searching" is done some other unstated way (one assumes by someone
roaming around with a clipboard, or PDA) the results of the search are
collated, and the answer is stored in the DNS, where it is just more
data.

While one can imagine ways by which new data might make its way into
that answer (the doc, or the version of it that I read, hints at some)
I don't see any sign of a "cleanup" protocol.

When something that is in the list of names returned in that magic PTR
record lookup, and the device (whatever) is summarily removed from the
network (unplugged, crashes, ...) and never returns, what causes its
name to ever be removed from the list?

Note, this isn't the same as just leaving stray old info in the DNS (the
SRV record pointed at, the A or AAAA records, etc) - those just contribute
to a little bit of zone bloat, they aren't used by anything other than if
someone deliberately wants to reference them (because of caching, or for
any other reason).   Getting rid of that old stuff is nice, but not
necessary.

On the other hand, old info (names of printers that haven't existed in
years) in the list of all the current available servers, is telling the users
that there is something out there that they can use, and unless the user
has some other knowledge of what names in the list should be ignored
(if you're going to expect them to have that knowledge, why not instead
just give them the positive knowledge about which they can use?)
then there are going to be constant problems ("The list says that the foobar
printer is available, yet nothing ever prints, why?")

That data really needs to be kept up to date - all the old stuff
(even down to printers that are just switched off, because the user
in the office next door doesn't like the noise).   (NBP managed to
do that adequately enough...)

There's nothing in the doc at all (not the one that was in the I-D
directories) that addresses this problem.   As I recall, it wasn't even
mentioned.

There seem to be two possibilities - human zone management (someone whose
job it is to constantly scan the list and remove anything which shouldn't
be there) in which case it clearly isn't zeroconf in any form.

Or some other system, which discovers which servers exist, and then uses
dynamic DNS to do the DNS updates (the draft hints at that one as one method
by which new entries might be made).

But what's the mechanism by which this other system discovers the servers?

This seems to be an essential ingredient of any zeroconf attempt to make
this proposal actually functional?

Then, once we have that method, why bother interposing some other manager
system and the DNS - why can't the end user applications just use the same
method?

Did you perhaps consider as possible that it was just that no good
implementations had appeared yet?   Perhaps people are quietly working on
them somewhere?   I suspect that for much of this, the problem isn't
really how to do the SLP part, it is how to integrate that with the
rest of the application in a nice way.   That is, I can easily write an
application that will use SLP to locate printers for me - it just isn't
hard.   But my printing system is still using /etc/printcap, so what
good would it do me?   Seems likely I would need to create a whole new
printing system, and while implementing SLP isn't hard, that is.

The same is true of other services as well of course, I can easily
serach for NFS file servers, but the mount command still expects me
to type the server name (or put it in fstab).

  | I didn't say in every situation...but if it supports IP, it supports DNS.

nonsense.   I have an nice logic analyser, that runs IP (can be commanded
that way, its data files can be uploaded, manipulated, returned, it also
wants to print wave forms, etc - mostly it uses a locallt attached printer,
but it would be nice if it could just find one on the net).

It has never heard of DNS - it has no need for that at all.

I can point you at other systems which also have no need of the DNS, as
they have no need of name translations.

  | But I can find all kinds of help and information on working with DNS...and
  | effectively nothing on SLP.

SLP is newer.   Is this any surprise.   You can find even more information
on working with wood than you can on working with the DNS.   Perhaps you
should be carving a path to your servers???

I already have this plank of wood ...

You're right there - if you're an end user today (and perhaps even Apple
wanting to ship something today), then using something new, for which there
isn't much support, today, is probably not the wisest choice.

But that isn't what we are here, what we're doing is designing the method
for tomorrow, for people to be able to use, after it has been well
implemented, documented, etc.  What we want to do is specify what we believe
is technically the best method (solves all the problems that need solving,
has no gaping holes, is implementable, etc).  We're not trying to answer
the question "what do I deploy now".

Try not to get confused here, remember the aim.

kre

ps: it is nice to see at least a proposal of a use for PTR that isn't for
address to name translation - this might encourage its use in other
situiations where it would work)

I assumed that (whatever the implementation) each device "registered" itself 
with the service discovery mechanism (be it a normal DNS server, a specialist 
DNS server, an SLP server, or something else).  If you have to manually find 
all the servers and type them in to some program, then that doesn't count as 
zeroconf to me.

I assumed that there would be a TTL (or equivalent) timeout.

Has to be some kind of timeout.'

Don't know how this was done in NBP (or is done in SLP), but the DNS analog is 
obvious.
<snip>

The main issue that seems to be missing is a standard API for doing the DNS-SD 
update (which is covered by one of the SLP RFCs IIRC - 2614 maybe?). Ideally, 
a common API for both DNS-SD and SLPv2 would be good, then programmers don't 
need to worry about the two systems that _have_ to co-exist in the future.

Or maybe you should give CUPS (www.cups.org) a chance, which is a lpr 
replacement and supports SLP.

I'll be at Linux-Kongress 2002 (aka 9th International Linux System Technology
Conference), which will be held in Cologne (Koln) from 4-6 September 2002.
See http://www.linux-kongress.org/2002/index.html for details.

If there are people with interest in implementing zeroconf technologies and
other networking "ease of use" ideas, eg SLP, that could be used in simple
networking scenarios), who will be at that conference, please let me know - I
will try to organise a Birds of a Feather session if there is any interest.

Sorry for the partly off-topic nature of this post.

SLP templates define which attributes are required.  If the name
attribute is required for a given service type, it must be included
in service advertisements of this type.  Precisely to address the
possibilities that

  * the service address will change
  * the service has more than one address associated with it
  * the service supports more than one access protocol
  * the service supports more than one transport protocol

there is a usage strategy for SLP called 'serviceid'.  Please see
http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-guttman-svrloc-serviceid-01.txt

This addresses the problem of persistent human readable names as
well as persistent unique identifiers for programs, that need to 
find the *same* service instance.  (Note that human readable names 
do not serve that purpose).

  | I assumed that (whatever the implementation) each device "registered"

  | a specialist DNS server, an SLP server, or something else).

That's the right approach for sure.   But the doc that's been under
discussion doesn't say how that should be done, just briefly mentions
some possibilities.

I agree.

  | I assumed that there would be a TTL (or equivalent) timeout.

That would be reasonable, it is the standard approach.   But there's no
way to do that using "standard DNS" - when something is put there, it
remains until something explicitly removes it.

And if (as above) devices are registering themselves, and it is in the DNS
then there isn't going to be anything to do that removal, after the device
has died without warning, is there?

The claimed attractivemess of this approach is that it works with "standard
DNS" - which means to me, by the same reasoning as yours, that it is either
not zeroconf at all, or simply doesn't work.

  | Don't know how this was done in NBP (or is done in SLP), but the
  | DNS analog is obvious.

If you're thinking that the DNS TTL is relevant here, it isn't.  That
just states for how long a cache can retain a record, it has no effect at
all on the lifetimes of records in authoritative servers (which for
these purposes are likely to be the only ones that exist, a DNS cache
would make no difference, one way or the other).

NBP worked by having the device itself answer when someone does a lookup.
Obviously, if it is dead, it doesn't answer.   That's another simple solution
to the problem.

SLP is similar, though a little more complex so it can scale better.

  | The main issue that seems to be missing is a standard API for doing
  | the DNS-SD update

No, the API for doing DNS updates, or at least, the protocol for it, is
well defined now.   The security issues of permitting it to be done are
a whole other question though.

  | (which is covered by one of the SLP RFCs IIRC - 2614 maybe?).

See RFC2136 and RFC3007 for how DNS updates are done.   The SLP RFC2608
for how it works in general (which is nothing like the DNS)

  | Ideally, a common API for both DNS-SD and SLPv2 would be good,

That sounds a like a good idea - an easy and defined way for a service
to make itself known, so server authors (file servers, printers, ...) could
all start coding for that, then the implementation of the API could be
filled in a bit later.

It is a bit tricky to define an API without knowing just what will be
under it, but perhaps something reasonable can be achieved for this.

2614 does that for just SLP, I suspect the DNS version needs extra work,
like which DNS domain this service is to pretend it is in (which is not
necessarily going to be related to the "host" name it has in the DNS).

  | then programmers don't 
  | need to worry about the two systems that _have_ to co-exist in the future.

no, one of them will die away, perhaps both of the current possibilities.
DNS-SD looks to simply have too many problems to survive for long.
SLP, who knows?

Too little evidence to make that assumption yet.

I think of it as: the device is the authoritative source, and everyone else is 
just caching (so the DNS server in DNS-SD is really on a cache, not a 
source).

So the service has to keep renewing its records (with the SLP server or the 
DNS-SD) before it times out and the cache dumps any reference.

And given the complexities of DNS security, this omission is non-trivial.
For example, is the DNS dynamic update to be protected by TSIG? In SLP
there is the option of the original RFC 2608 security model, as well as an
emerging IPsec-based security model.

While Stuart mentioned that using DNS SRV to find an SLP DA might be
equivalent to using DNS SRV alone, from a security point of view, they are
potentially very different. The IPsec security model for SLP enables the
SLP DA to authenticate the querier, and provides end-to-end security,
where the SLP DA actually knows who the querier is. In a pure DNS-based
model, this is not the case, since queries may come from a DNS server
located far from the original querier, and the original querier is not
known. This makes a difference for things like geographic load balancing.

If the document under discussion is draft-cheshire-dnsext-nias-01.txt
(there have been several documents discussed recently), section 7 explains
that how the data gets into DNS is out of scope of the document, and
merely provides pointers to some possibilities (as you pointed out). In
fact most of the suggested possibilities do *not* involve the device
registering itself with a central directory.

Only one of the suggested mechanisms in section 7 requires manually
finding servers and entering them.

NIAS by itself does not make a zeroconf network. I don't think anybody is
claiming that it does. It allows browsing of a network given existing
(DNS-based) naming infrastructure. It does not attempt to provide zeroconf
naming or addressing; those are provided elsewhere, and NIAS can be used
with or without those.

Zeroconf addressing is provided by IPv4 linklocal addressing
(draft-ietf-zeroconf-ipv4-linklocal-05.txt, implemented in Macs and
Windows for several years now) and IPv6 stateless autoconfiguration.

Zeroconf naming is provided by multicast DNS
(draft-cheshire-dnsext-multicastdns-01.txt).

Zeroconf browsing is provided by NIAS (draft-cheshire-dnsext-nias-01.txt).

To see the whole zeroconf picture you need to look at all three aspects.

If you use manual entry as the way to get records into your traditional
unicast DNS server, then it seems reasonable that manual removal is how
you get them out.

If you use multicast DNS to provide the DNS records, then they have TTLs
and when a device is no longer around to claim its presence its records
will soon disappear from any caches.

If you use any of the other techniques suggested in section 7 of the NIAS
draft to add records (or have them added automatically) there will be a
corresponding and appropriate way to delete those records (or have them
deleted automatically).

One piece of it by itself provides only a certain amount of benefit.
Similarly, zeroconf addressing and naming do not provide huge benefits by
themselves. They work and provide benefit by themselves, but for the full
`zeroconf experience' you put all three together.

Further, not only do the three zeroconf mechanisms build on each other,
they build on existing protocols and infrastructure. Rather than build an
entire zeroconf protocol that does everything from scratch, the problem
has been divided up and each part of the problem has been solved
separately with a focus not just on working with each other but on working
with existing protocols.

Like to run your home network with assigned addresses but don't want to
(or know how to) run your own DNS server just to get names? Use multicast
DNS.

Already got managed addresses and DNS but would like users to be able to
browse for services on the network? Use NIAS with traditional DNS. Don't
want the hassle of manually keeping each record up to date? Use DNS
update (still with NIAS).

Bump into somebody at a conference/meeting/lunch and want to share some
files? Use linklocal addresses, multicast DNS and NIAS to find your
acquaintance's services.

You're right, if you choose to manually add your DNS entries those entries
will need to be manually removed too.

When you plug NIAS and multicast DNS together, that's pretty much what you
get (and that's the intent).

If your hostname is foo.example.org and an application registers a web
server by the name of `My Webcam', I would expect the resulting DNS
records to be for `My Webcam._http._tcp.example.org' i.e. under the same
domain as the host. The whole point is that it is *not* the hostname, but
reusing the domain name seems like the most sensible idea. If your host is
running in a zeroconf environment and using multicast DNS it will use the
domain local.arpa, resulting in records for `My Webcam._http._tcp.local.arpa'.

I don't see any problems with that. It seems fairly straightforward and
I'm not sure what you think needs extra work here.

I think you think there are more problems than there really are. Check out
the other zeroconf drafts, see the piece of the problem that each is
trying to solve, and see how they fit together to provide some real zero
configuration.

P.S. it would probably assist in tracking down and referring to the drafts
in question if they were republished :-)

You have to get the information in somehow, and even with 'automatic'
discovery, someone is still going to give it a human readable name, if
nothing else, to avoid having ten printers all named "HP LaserJet 5si/MX".
And those names will be how people find the things when they go to find a
printer anyway.

Complaints to the maintainers of the records in that case, in the same way
that old server names are removed now.

Um, yes, it is necessary, to stop the emails and phone calls about server
'foo' being down...it's not *down*, it's gone, and cleaning up DNS records
is good housekeeping, alone with good security.

That's the same thing that happens with old computer entries in DNS..."I

Nothing worse than you do now.  If you had a printer set up, it stayed set
up regardless of it's real state. NBP didn't remove it from your list of set
- up printers, it just removed it from the list of printers when you were
browsing for one.

SLP won't fix that problem either, unless you are telling me that SLP
changes user settings automatically, which would be a *very* bad thing.

If the DNS naming and address assignment are all done automatically, then
that sort of human intervention isn't needed. If you are making manual PTR
entries, then you are bypassing the Zero part of zeroconf anyway.

That's like winking in the dark...you may be quite busy, but no one else
knows you're doing it. It's either in the OS, or it's not going to be used.
This has to be an integrated part of the human experience on a platform, not
some third party utility that may or may not break with every OS update, and
has a separate security model.

It has to be integrated into the OS...applications shouldn't implement any
printer or resource discovery at all...that's what OS's do.

Why not integrate SLP and IPP into the OS?

Which is one of many reasons why NFS is not the defacto standard for file

I didn't say it implements, I said it supports DNS. It can be used with DNS.

Perhaps the very smart people who think SLP is the answer should do some
documentation instead of letting the schlubs trying to implement it do that

If the SLP designers had thought of implementation and documentation in
equal parts with features, we wouldn't need to have this argument.

I am remembering the aim. And I'm trying to get the people doing the
designing to remember the inconvenient fact that neither SLP *or* ZeroConf
are breaking new ground here. There are a few efforts that have been made in
this area and none of them are used. I don't care how good, capable, or
ground breaking an idea is, if it can't be implemented quickly, easily, and
transparently, then *NO ONE* is going to use this outside of a test lab.
Zeroconf/Rendevous isn't even a standard, but right now, it has a better
implementation than SLP. Maybe thinking about the deployment/maintenance end
of things more often would result in fewer ideas being thrown into the
wastebin.

Creation is the first 80% here...implementation is the last 20%, and
probably more important in the long run.

It's still not as integrated as it needs to be in enough operating systems.
But it is a really nice implementation, other than that.

In other words, DNS-SD should be standardized because there is a good 
proprietary implementation for a single platform. 

BTW, better than which SLP implementation? The one in MacOSX, Solaris, Novell 
NetWare, Lexmark printer servers, OpenSLP...

The only problem is that it's on *one* platform. If it works well, then use
that as a base.

Mac OS X's, to put a point on it, sucks. Sun's is more complete, and more
unwieldy. I don't use Novell, so no opinion there. The same for Lexmark
printer services. It's not on windows yet, in fact, if you look in
Microsoft's support base, the only mention of SLP is adding it as a DHCP
option for Novell DHCP clients.

So lets see here...out of the platforms I have direct control over daily:

Mac OS X:   File servers only
Sun:        The widest use of SLP, and the worst configuration
            setup...."just write your own C or C++ program..." should NEVER
            be a part of a network service implementation guide for Network
            Admins.
AIX:        SLP doesn't appear to be a part of AIX, and from what I can see,
            IBM is only using it for it's "Host on demand" services, and
            it's SNA gateway products.
Windows:    Doesn't exist

So, we see out of four platforms, one company has limited support, and it's
bad, (Apple), One has more complete support, but a really poorly designed
setup (Sun), one only uses it for a very small set of services, (IBM), and
one is ignoring it completely, (Microsoft).

So SLP, after a few years on the market, has been so poorly implemented that
it's only in slightly wider use than a brand new scheme, Zeroconf.

It finally occurs to me why these ambiguities haven't been resolved by the 
guys who probably have a working system - Apple. Apple has almost certainly 
embargoed people talking about implementation details until after the OS 
10.1.2 release.

Maybe all will be clearer after 24 August (which I think is when apple were 
going to open source the mDNS responder too)

You can think of it that way if you like, but this isn't the DNS, and no

With SLP, yes, that's how its designed.   With DNS, no.   Remember DNS-SD
is just a technique of using the existing DNS to perform SD, it isn't
something new of itself.   That's its biggest feature...   To retain that
it must remain the same old DNS we have always had (mDNS alternatives not
being relevant either way here).   That is, the DNS server simply will not
time out and dump any data.

  | If the document under discussion is draft-cheshire-dnsext-nias-01.txt

That has been my assumption, except -01 doesn't exist, so -00 is what
I have been looking at.

  | (there have been several documents discussed recently), section 7 explains
  | that how the data gets into DNS is out of scope of the document, and
  | merely provides pointers to some possibilities (as you pointed out). In
  | fact most of the suggested possibilities do *not* involve the device
  | registering itself with a central directory.

Yes.   I agree.

  | Only one of the suggested mechanisms in section 7 requires manually
  | finding servers and entering them.

True.

  | NIAS by itself does not make a zeroconf network.

No, of course not.   Whoever claimed that it should?   The question is
whether it (really) works at all (as distinct from: seems to work in
some environments).

And here (in this WG) zeroconf nets are the ones that matter, how it works
on configured networks is kind of relevant to see whether a good zeroconf
idea will scale, but it has to be a good zeroconf idea first.   (Alternatively
it could be a good idea somewhere else, and this WG could look at it to
see if it is suitable for zeroconf).

  | If you use manual entry as the way to get records into your traditional
  | unicast DNS server, then it seems reasonable that manual removal is how
  | you get them out.

Fine, but that's not zeroconf, so that part isn't relevant here.

  | If you use multicast DNS to provide the DNS records, then they have TTLs
  | and when a device is no longer around to claim its presence its records
  | will soon disappear from any caches.

Yes, that would work OK, though there's another problem with doing that
that I will mention below.

  | If you use any of the other techniques suggested in section 7 of the NIAS
  | draft to add records (or have them added automatically) there will be a
  | corresponding and appropriate way to delete those records (or have them
  | deleted automatically).

Will there?   What is it?   If the other technique is the "manager"
service, then there should be no great problem, but once again, if
that manager service is able to figure out what servers exist, why can't
the clients all just copy what it does, and thus avoid the need for it
to exist at all?   One less piece required.

Or, if it is the "device registers itself" technique, then what is it that
does the removal when the device is dead?   For this one, I don't see an
answer at all.  Your "there will be" looks like hand waving.

Note that a lookup protocol is just noise unless there's some way access
the data that is to be looked up.   It doesn't help at all to be able to
say "well, this will work fine if we have the data collected ..." - if
data collection is required, then how that happens is every bit as
important as how the lookup is done by the client, and can't just be
swept away as someone else's problem.

  | Further, not only do the three zeroconf mechanisms build on each other,
  | they build on existing protocols and infrastructure.

That's all nice, provided that "build upon" is what they do, and isn't
"tear down and attempt to reconstruct, differently".   No, don't complain,
I'm not claiming that anything I have seen so far (certainly nothing that
is actually in the NIAS draft) is doing that, but remember this when you
read a little below.

  | Bump into somebody at a conference/meeting/lunch and want to share some
  | files? Use linklocal addresses, multicast DNS and NIAS to find your
  | acquaintance's services.

Hmm - remembering the "build on existing protocols" (and for now
assuming that multicast DNS is an existing protocol) how does NIAS
actually work in that scenario?

As I understand it, I do a lookup for _service._tcp.my.domain. (my.domain
might be local.arpa or something here, forget that, it isn't important for
this point).

Who or what can answer that?   Remember, that in the "existing DNS" there
can only be one answer - if there are two different answers, at most one of
them is correct.  It is completely incorrect to merge answers.

So, let's assume there are 4 people and lunch, and three of them have
printers with them (strange lunch...) and I'm the one who doesn't.  I want
to print.   I lookup _printer._tcp.whatever.it.is.   Who answers?
How does that one get the data about the other two to include in the
answer?

  | When you plug NIAS and multicast DNS together, that's pretty much what you
  | get (and that's the intent).

Except NBP specifically merged the answers from multiple replies - each
reply would be just about "me" (the respondent).  DNS very explicitly does
not permit that.   If you want merging, you're using some other protocol.

  | If your hostname is foo.example.org and an application registers a web
  | server by the name of `My Webcam', I would expect the resulting DNS
  | records to be for `My Webcam._http._tcp.example.org' i.e. under the same
  | domain as the host. The whole point is that it is *not* the hostname, but
  | reusing the domain name seems like the most sensible idea. If your host is
  | running in a zeroconf environment and using multicast DNS it will use the
  | domain local.arpa, resulting in records for `My Webcam._http._tcp.local.arpa'.
  | 
  | I don't see any problems with that. It seems fairly straightforward and
  | I'm not sure what you think needs extra work here.

You missed my point.   Sure, if my webcam, on my box, whose name is
foo.example.org registers itself, then "My Webcam._http._tcp.example.org"
would be an obvious possible name, and that would expect to be included
in the "_http._tcp.example.org" PTR RRset.   That much (at least as a
default) isn't very hard to figure out.

The problem is how the user who wants to find the webcam knows that it
should be doing a PTR lookup of "_http._tcp.example.org".   Its domain
name happens to be "bar.example.com".   All of this is at that conference
you mentioned above.   I'm connected to the net, and I want to find the
camera.   I can do a PTR lookup for "_http._tcp.example.com" but all that
can ever find are the cameras back in the office (and maybe one connected
to my system).  That isn't what I'm looking for, I'm looking for the one
covering the session I wanted to attend but couldn't get into the room...

I hope there's no buried assumption in here that there's any relationship
at all between nets and domain names ?   There might be some environments
where you might expect everything to be living in one nice domain, so if
I discover my own domain somehow, I can expect the printers, cameras, file
servers, ... to all be in the same domain.   But it isn't any environment
I've ever lived in.

  | I think you think there are more problems than there really are. Check out

  | configuration.

I have read them.  But solving all of zeroconf isn't what I am concerned
about.   Just "Does NIAS really work for finding servers".   You may (or
perhaps not) have seen that I don't often comment in this WG.  Most of
what goes on here isn't of great interest to me.   But when someone claims
"just use the DNS" as the answer to some problem, then I tend to look
closer.   And I will comment if the approach looks to be unsound (as it
is the vast majority of times someone suggests using the DNS for anything
that isn't a direct hostname lookup).

  | P.S. it would probably assist in tracking down and referring to the drafts
  | in question if they were republished :-)

Yes, I have made that point in private mail.

  | You have to get the information in somehow, and even with 'automatic'
  | discovery, someone is still going to give it a human readable name, if
  | nothing else, to avoid having ten printers all named "HP LaserJet 5si/MX".
  | And those names will be how people find the things when they go to find a
  | printer anyway. 

That needs to be done - but the people who name printers, and the people
that manage the DNS, are rarely the same group.   So, somehow they need
to communicate, or the printer (after it is named) needs to communicate
with the DNS server, or something.   It is that step that is the data
collection that is being done, to allow DNS-SD to be a straight lookup
that the DNS can cope with, rather than a search, which it cannot.

But the specification on how this necessary step is to be done is lacking.
That's a probloem.

  | Complaints to the maintainers of the records in that case, in the same way
  | that old server names are removed now.

Which maintainers of the records??    Remember that (here at least) we're
looking at this working in a zeroconf environment.   That means, there's
no-one maintaining things.   You can swear at the cabling, or the 802.11
access points, all you like, but they're neither of those will eventually
get sick of your complaints and go edit a DNS zone file for you.  Nor
do they have a boss...

If this protocol is ever to be useful for zeroconf, it has to work in
a network with no administrators - and that includes having old data vanish.

Now, of course, how that happens will depend upon how the data is collected
in the first place - but there's no specification for that either.

  | Um, yes, it is necessary, to stop the emails and phone calls about server
  | 'foo' being down...it's not *down*, it's gone, and cleaning up DNS records
  | is good housekeeping, alone with good security.

Good housekeeping perhaps, it has nothing in the slightest to do with
security.   But in any case, cleaning up specific records (certainly a
nice thing to do) doesn't cause great problems if not done.   Failing to
clean up the magic PTR record would.

So the latter has to have a solution, the other can be left as "someone
will do it, and if not, it doesn't really hurt much anyway".

I don't know if you've ever actually maintained a large DNS server, but
"cleaning out the crap" is the hardest part of that - because it can be
very very hard to figure out what is crap, and should be removed, and what
is just "not there right now".   I think if you look at almost any large
DNS configuration, you'll find all kinds of obsolete stuff still just sitting
there - not being deleted, as there's no-one around who is actually very
confident that it is obsolete.

Again, this doesn't matter for normal DNS records, they consume some space,
occasionally lead someone to believe that some resource is in use (a particular
name, perhaps IP address) but don't cause any serious problems.  Not true of
the NIAS magic PTR record - that has to be kept (relatively) clean to be
useful.

  | That's the same thing that happens with old computer entries in DNS..."I
  | keep getting time out errors, is that server down?"

Sure.   And that's exactly the point.   When that happens, what do you
expect the user to do?   The normal thing would be "well, I'll see if I
can find another one instead".   How do I do that?   Well, if DNS-SD is
the accepted technique, I run my DNS-SD application, and have it fetch the
PTR record value, and I look through that.

All that is fine, normal even - provided the PTR record actually lists
stuff that are available to use now (at least the vast majority) and not
"every server we have seen in the past 10 years".

For that, cleanup is required (it doesn't have to be instant, if a
server has just failed, and hasn't been removed, people will cope).

  | Nothing worse than you do now.  If you had a printer set up, it stayed set
  | up regardless of it's real state. NBP didn't remove it from your list of set
  | - up printers, it just removed it from the list of printers when you were
  | browsing for one.

Once again, exactly.   That's what should be achieved.   We can't ask for
more, that would be asking for too much.   But neither should we accept
less - when browsing, I need to see the printers I can use *now*.

  | SLP won't fix that problem either, unless you are telling me that SLP
  | changes user settings automatically, which would be a *very* bad thing.

Not the problem you just invented as being the one you wanted solved, no.
It does solve the browsing problem though - dead servers will vanish from
the list you get back from SLP (perhaps not instantly, but that's OK, they
won't remain forever).

  | If the DNS naming and address assignment are all done automatically, then
  | that sort of human intervention isn't needed. If you are making manual PTR
  | entries, then you are bypassing the Zero part of zeroconf anyway.

Yes, of course.   That was my point.   But how?   Just assuming it
will happen, somehow, isn't good enough.   What if no-one can ever
find a way that works?   Or what if the way that is found doesn't
work with DNS at all?

  | It has to be integrated into the OS...applications shouldn't implement any
  | printer or resource discovery at all...that's what OS's do.

Whatever.   What OS's should do, and should not do, is a religious
discussion that we don't need to have, as it doesn't matter here.
All that matters is that something does it.   That is, as long as
the application that wants to print can find its printer, we have
success, right?

  | I didn't say it implements, I said it supports DNS. It can be used with DNS.

Then the statement has no meaning.   Anything can be used with the DNS,
even if the method of doing that is just to ignore the DNS...


  | I don't care how good, capable, or
  | ground breaking an idea is, if it can't be implemented quickly, easily, and

nonsense.   I'll bet you use lots of things every day that weren't
originally implemented quickly easily or transparently.   What's the
CPU in the system that you're using?   How does it meet your criteria?

  | Zeroconf/Rendevous isn't even a standard, but right now, it has a better
  | implementation than SLP.

Whether this is true or not (it is certainly debatable) it is irrelevant.

  | Maybe thinking about the deployment/maintenance end
  | of things more often would result in fewer ideas being thrown into the
  | wastebin.

This I certainly agree with.   But you're jumping to conclusions.
That is, you're looking and not seeing any SLP that you consider acceptable,
and concluding from that that the reason is that it can't be done.  I don't
know how that is supposed to follow.

Right...but then you are choosing to not have that aspect of Zeroconf
functional on your network, and you have to deal with the fallout. You can
avoid this by using mDNS for things you don't require to exist in a
permanent settings file.

I have submitted a document to the internet draft editor which
includes all comments which were agreed to during the working
group action.

http://www.merit.edu/mail.archives/zeroconf/2002-05/msg00027.html

This means that all outstanding issues from the IETF last call on
this document have been properly dealt with.  The document will
now be put in the hands of the IESG, with the request to advance
the document to proposed standard.

I have arranged a BoF session for Linux-Kongress 2002 on automatic networking 
technology implementation. A full description of what is planned is on line 
at http://www.linux-kongress.org/2002/bofs/index.html#zeroconf

The BoF will be held Thursday 5-September-2002, in Cologne (Koln), Germany. 
The BoF will officially start at 1430, and run until 1600 (local time). 
However I will try to be at the room from about 1400 to welcome people and 
have informal discussions. We may have to vacate the room after (depends on 
other BoFs that are still to be scheduled) and find a pub or coffee house if 
it runs a bit long.

Erik Guttman and I (well, mostly Erik, I guess) will be moderating it. I 
already have some expressions of interest from CUPS developers who will be at 
the conference, but if anyone else with an interest in this area can make, 
it'd be great to see you there.

Full conference details are on their web-site (see above). I strongly 
encourage you to register (even if only for the day), although it is not 
absolutely mandatory if you only want to attend the BoF.
If you don't register, you can't go to the official talks and wont get any 
coffee in the breaks etc. and no printed proceedings. You can attend the 
exhibition though.

Sorry if this is too off-topic, but a get-together for a few hours can often 
overcome weeks of emails, so this might be a good chance to progress things.

An interesting set of comments -- thanks.

I think it is fair to say that there are two protocols in operation
here.  One is the standard DNS protocol, deployed today with various
bits of goop added to zone files.  If that were not the case then
DNS-SD would just not work in the case where you were using unicast
DNS and knew a domain name.

The second protocol is the thing that looks like NBP and merges
results.  That thing (according to Stuarts multicast DNS draft)
uses link-local multicast, aggregates the results, and always
uses the domain name "local.arpa" for multicast requests.
Thus discovery of all the "link local lunch line printers"
ought to be possible.

If the problem here is one of naming (ie that multicast DNS
has the acronymn "DNS" in it), that can be fixed pretty simply:
call the thing something different.  LLMNR perhaps.. ;-)

I believe Stuart's NIAS proposal would need tweaking to make it
compatible with the current dnsext LLMNR document..
http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-ietf-dnsext-mdns-11.txt
In particular, the local.arpa domain name has gone away.
You either have a global domain name, or none and both flavours
of names may be resolved using multicast.

Yes there is - when you want to discover all the stuff on a local
link using DNS formatted multicast packets (ie the !DNS protocol)
everybody needs to agree on a domain suffix.  Possible suffixes
could be any.old.thing. or nothing at all.  Personally I prefer
nothing at all.  LLMNR allows both.  Stuart's version of mDNS
always uses "local.arpa".

I'm not sure what the permanent settings file has to do with anything,
but more importantly, mDNS and DNS on the same net was, last I heard,
undefined - it leaves too many possible holes (as well as making it
difficult for the client nodes to figure out what to do).

On a baby net with no real DNS, then mDNS would avoid the cleanup problem,
but still leaves the "there can only be one server of any type" problem to
replace it (remember, no merging of the replies).

That sounds like it would work if you're doing a PTR lookup to find
a service.   If you're doing an A lookup to find an address associated
with a name, is "merges the results" really going to have the
required semantics?

That is, you're hoping there will only be one owner of the name, so the
issue shouldn't arise (as "merging" results in normal DNS is an issue
that should never arise, if everything is operating correctly).

But what if there's not?   Should the mDNS level (whatever it gets
called) just hand you back all of the A records, as if they came in
one answer?

That seems wrong to me.

If that's correct, then is the suggestion that whether merging is done
or not should depend upon the RR type being sought?

That would create difficulties for future types wouldn't it?   How would
software deployed now know whether some future type should be merged or not?

In any case, that doesn't seem adequate anyway - if the PTR lookup is
being done to find an IN-ADDR.ARPA then I don't think I want the results
merged do I?   They're perhaps even less likely to be multiple results,
but no guarantee.

So, it can't be the RR type (relief: no need to worry about the problems
that would cause), but instead it looks as if the merging or not merging
should be decided by the purpose of the lookup.

So, now we have a "kind of like normal DNS" mDNS lookup for normal requests,
and a "different from normal DNS" mDNS lookup for SD type requests.

To me, that looks just like two different protocols, even if the bit formats
on the wire happen to be the same - that is, to make it work, it is bending
the "DNS" concept so much, including the way it is normally used in mDNS,
that keeping pretending they're the same is not worthwhile.  That is, we
claim they're the same so we can convince people that we're just building
on existing infrastructure & protocols - but then we go tell them "but by the
way, we have to make this change, and that change, and ..."

The issue here is that we need a protocol that can gracefully work as
the net it is corrected to grows, and changes character.   That doesn't
mean that we have to send only one kind of query packet (mDNS or DNS),
that kind of decision can be made based upon whether there are any DNS
servers answering (or some other way).   That's OK.

What I mean is that the basic method has to work for all sizes of nets.

The domain name issue (as you explain) is probably irrelevant for true
baby nets, the domain name part can just get ignored, or be a fixed
string, or whatever.

But as the net gets bigger, it can't - if you're going to query real
DNS servers, you have to send real DNS queries, and they have to have
real domains in them, or they don't work at all.

How does DNS-SD work in a multi-domain network?   How does the client
discover what domain (or domains) it is supposed to be sending its query
to?   It sounds as if we need a "domain discovery protocol" in order
to allow DNS-SD to work (if DNS-SZ is NBP, then this new one might be ZIP,
or parts of it).

Where's that part?   And please don't tell me it uses DNS, it can't...

By that definition, you aren't running DNS at all, as the only way to get
rid of old stuff is manually, and according to you, that's not sane.

I read the files on it, and it seems quite defined to me, and I didn't see
any issues with client nodes either.

Um...I'm not getting that problem from the way that Zeroconf works, so I'm
going to assume you are getting entirely different ideas from it than I am.

Unicast DNS can return multiple answers in one packet regardless of 
record type. The difference with mDNS is the possibility that the 
multiple answers would arrive in different packets.

I don't think so. In the case of mDNS the "merging" of answers in 
separate packets should be done for any RRs.

The mDNS that Stuart Cheshire has proposed would only send queries in 
specific domains to the multicast address. in-addr.arpa is not one of 
those domains although 254.169.in-addr.arpa is for the purpose of 
performing reverse lookups on IPv4 link-local addresses. It is pretty 
obvious there can be no authoritative name server for performing 
reverse lookups for addresses in the 169.254.0.0/16 network.

Not necessarily. If you have two hosts that decide they are logically 
the same so they both respond with A records for the same name, it 
would not be unlike cases where a unicast DNS server contains two A 
records for one name. The difference is that the replies would be in 
separate packets in the mDNS case.

Yes, a resolver handling mDNS would need to be a bit different from a 
unicast DNS implementation. A resolver handling mDNS would need to join 
the multicast group. In addition, the resolver would probably need to 
have code to send multicast requests on all interfaces as well as code 
to join together answers from multiple packets.

While it's great to see all the interest in discussion of mDNS, it's worth
noting that mDNS is a work item of the DNSEXT WG, *not* of the Zeroconf
WG. So discussions of mDNS really need to occur on the DNSEXT WG mailing
list.

Both Stuart's mDNS draft and dnsext's LLMNR check for the uniqueness
of the name.

Perhaps only if it is a protocol called "*DNS*"?

Exactly.  That is what I was trying to point out in my previous

There is another effect too:  If you call something "*DNS*", you step
on hallowed turf, and all kinds of people come out of the woodwork
and start whacking you over the head.  There are a lot of parochial
gardeners tending that particular piece of turf.

The "one size fits all" protocol would be nice, but it isn't an
absolute requirement in my opinion.  Both DNS-SD(aka NIAS) and SLP
seem to fit this picture reasonably well.

There isn't currently a "domain discovery protocol" that I know of,
rather it is assumed that the user knows a useful domain and can type.
A device without a keyboard can be configured with the (only just
recently specified and not yet deployed) domain search list option
for DHCP to find things in other domains, or the (not yet agreed upon)
IPv6 version of the same thing.

It strikes me that the situation is not a whole lot different for SLP.
The up-scaled version requires DNS/SRV SLP DA discovery (and acronymn
expansion to go along with it).

Fair point.

Most of the discussion has been about two drafts (Stuart's mDNS and
NIAS drafts) which are not currently wg documents.  Given that LLMNR
*is* a wg document, it would appear to have a reasonable chance of
going forward.  I would like to see DNS-SD/NIAS tweaked so that it
played nice with LLMNR.

The more general discussion about service discovery doesn't appear
to be DNS specific..  Zeroconf seems as reasonable a place as any
right now.

Hi all,

One of the things that bugs me about the DNS-SD/NIAS proposal is the
use of TXT records to return the "other stuff" that is needed to use
a discovered service.  One example given is the lpr print queue name..

Are we really happy to do this?  What if the printer has two queues?
Do we end up putting lumps of XML, or RDF, or comma seperated thingies
into the TXT record?  Surely we don't want to go there...

To have interoperability the contents and parsing of these TXT records
needs to be specified somewhere.  This would be pretty much the same
as creating an SLP service template.  Creating yet another one of
these doesn't appear to me as an obvious win.

Are there any other options?

  | Not necessarily. If you have two hosts that decide they are logically 
  | the same so they both respond with A records for the same name, it 
  | would not be unlike cases where a unicast DNS server contains two A 
  | records for one name.

I don't think that's true.   If I get a DNS response that says a name
has two A records, what that is telling me is that I can use either one,
and both will get me to the same place (one might be better or worse for
the routing system, but that's not relevant here).   It doesn't matter
for this whether or not the A records reach the same hardware or not,
the existence of two addresses for the same name is a promise that the
two are equivalent.

On the other hand, if I get two systems each of which things it is
called "pc1" on my net, and both return A records, the chances that they'll
be equivalent is vanishingly small.

I believe that merging RRs into an RRSet from different replies is a
bad idea, always, regardless of the method used to elicit the replies.

When I get duplicate A's, I can either just pick one at random (then the
other host will appear not to exist, for now anyway), or most likely
better, complain about the duplicate and return neither (neither host will
be visible until the problem is fixed).

The problem with the better approach is that it means that it is no longer
possible to simply get a reply, and start processing, which is what would
normally be done (and the "random" selection amounts to "the reply that
arrived first").   All queries would need to wait for a timeout just
in case there's another reply waiting to arrive.    That would be required
if merging the results was the desirable outcome.

That's why, in practice here, what is done is application dependent.
If I'm doing a search, I wait, and merge.  If I'm doing what I think is
a specific query, I simply accept the first result, and process that
(which is not merging).

That difference is why I'm suggesting that there really are two different
protocols being describer here.

This part is what I believe it should not have, normally, and normally

That's fine for a lookup (find all printers ...) kind of application,
people expect that might take a short while.   It isn't good for a
"ping pc1" or "http://pc1/..." type lookup however.

It is up to the server, not the client to make sure that multiple 
conflicting responses are not sent. In the case of mDNS, an mDNS 
responder should verify that any records it is advertising do not 
conflict with records another responder is advertising. The burden 
should lay on the responders, not the clients.

Is this not already done with unicast DNS? Some DNS clients that want 
to lookup A and AAAA records may send multiple queries. The results of 
the query for A records would be merged with the result for the AAAA 
record query before returning the information to the application 
performing the lookup. Merging for RRsets is already done today, makes 
sense, and is useful.

This is true with unicast DNS. If a unicast server has two A entries 
for the same name that point to totally different machines, mayhem will 
ensue. Just as a server administrator would have to ensure they don't 
put conflicting information in their database, an mDNS responder would 
have to ensure that it doesn't generate conflicting information.

This does make life more challenging. As you noted before, the type of 
query being performed can affect whether or not multiple replies are 
important. In the case of an A record lookup, if a host has two 
interfaces on the same link, and advertises a name on that link, the 
resolver library could return the first response and everything would 
work. On the other hand, when trying to discover services, the first 
response would not be sufficient to locate all of the services out 
there.

In addition, the timeout would not need to be anywhere near as long as 
it is for unicast timeout. It is not unreasonable to expect that any or 
every machine on the local link would be able to respond within a 
second to a multicast query. Unicast can not set such a short timeout 
for a variety of reasons.

I don't think there are two protocols, but I do think there are two 
APIs required.

I would argue that a query for a service, from a clients point of view, 
should never really end. Services come and go, so a client ought to sit 
in a loop waiting for notification of services coming and going. This 
has little to do with the on the wire protocol, how the server behaves, 
or the format of the packets. Only the APIs that control how a process 
on a machine would get the results of a query would need to differ.

My philosophy here is very deliberately a behavioural model of networking
-- I believe the only sensible question in this context is not, "What are 
you?", but, "What protocol do you speak?"

If you walk like a duck and quack like a duck, then I'll treat you as a 
duck.

If I'm writing an IPP client, then I want to find other things on the 
network that speak IPP. It doesn't matter if they archive the documents 
onto CDR instead of printing them on paper -- if they speak IPP, then my 
IPP client will talk to them.

Conversely, finding "a thing that prints on paper" (whatever that means, 
in a precise sense) and then asking what protocols it speaks doesn't help 
me, if the answer is that it speaks only PSPAPATUDPIP 
(Postscript-over-Printer-Access-protocol-over-AppleTalk-tunneled-over-UDP-o
ver-IP). That's no use at all to a client that implements only IPP.

What an IPP client wants to know is, "Who can I talk to?"

Right, but you mean, "_printer._tcp.<yourdomain>"
The IANA protocol name for LPR is "printer", not "lpr".
(Search for "515" in <http://www.iana.org/assignments/port-numbers>.)
I made this same mistake in my draft a year ago, and I need to fix it.

A client that implements LPR looks for "_printer._tcp.<yourdomain>"
A client that implements IPP looks for "_ipp._tcp.<yourdomain>"
A client that implements both looks for both.

>If there services which support many different protocols this seems

If there are devices that support many different protocols, then
that itself is the problem, not the discovery step of the process.

If there are n printing protocols, then Apple (and any other client 
vendor) has to support n different ways of printing, each with their own 
features, bugs, and deficiencies. Printer vendors each have to support n 
different ways of printing. That is the big burden.

I'd like to see a world where there's one and only one accepted way of 
printing over IP, and that way of printing works really well.

In the meantime, there are currently a small number of different ways of 
printing, and we do have to support that, but lets recognise that as a 
problem to be reduced over time, not a desirable thing to be proliferated.

A question for Robert:

DNS UPDATE currently specifies no time-out, refresh period, or other 
garbage collection mechanism to purge old records created by long-dead 
clients.

Do you see this as:
(a) a wonderful feature of the DNS UPDATE mechanism, to be cherished, or
(b) an oversight in the DNS UPDATE mechanism, which should be fixed

I'm not looking for a protracted digression here; I'm not looking for

of your opinion, if possible.

Two weeks ago I asked:

><http://files.dns-sd.org/draft-cheshire-dnsext-nias.txt>
>How many people have read the draft and think it is a good idea?
>How many people have read the draft and think it is a bad idea?

Here is a summary of the responses I received:

Brad Hards:      "I think it is good" is closer to my opinion.
Alex Karahalios:  I've read NIAS and I think it is good.
Joshua Graessley: I've read NIAS and I think it is good.
Mark Thompson:    I've read NIAS and I think it is good, - but flawed.
John C. Welch:    I've read NIAS and I think it is good.
Varuni Witana:    I've read NIAS and I think it is bad.
Dan Nicolae:      I read it (fast) and I think the idea of using
                  DNS for discovery in ad-hoc networks is good.
Robert Elz:       If you seriously expect the WG to consider this,
                  you really should take the effort to keep it current
                  (Robert didn't like it.)

This is a small sample (though not too different to the response you get 
when asking about any Internet Draft), but the results appear to be:

Generally Positive: 6
Generally Negative: 2

So, there appears to be some limited interest in this.
There are two ways to proceed now:

1. The IETF community would like to take charge of this work
   and help evolve it in a sensible direction.

2. The IETF community has no interest in this,
   and Apple should just publish it as an Informational RFC.

Thoughts?

Correct.

Neither of those.

(b) is easy to handle - this certainly wasn't an oversight, when dynamic
updates were being designed there was a lot of work spent on attempting
to achieve exactly what you're suggesting should be done, records that
get inserted for a time, and if they're not refreshed, vanish (or something
else more or less equivalent to that)

So "an oversight" it certainly isn't.

(a) it isn't either - no-one believes that it is great that there's no
way to add something to the DNS for a limited period, and then have it
go away all by itself.

The problem is that it is essentially impossible to make work.

The principle problem is not how one would manage to tell the primary
server that the data was supposed to vanish, but how that server would
pass along that information to secondary servers.  AXFR (sometimes now
IXFR, but that makes no difference) is the most common way that the servers
for a zone communicate, and AXFR transfers the RRs and only the RRs, no
additional data.   There's nowhere in there where "this record should vanish
after a day" can be shoehorned in.

One might think that the primary server could do all the work, make the
data vanish, increment the serial number, then notify the secondary servers
of the zone change - at which point the secondary servers would refresh
their copies of the zone, and the data would be gone.

But even this has two problems - first, up to the point of the notify,
while the primary server could have been answering queries with progressively
shorter TTLs so that caches won't be keeping the data beyond its validity
date - but secondary servers know nothing of this, and would be answering
queries with the initial TTL of the RR up to the instant it is deleted.
Whether this is a serious problem or not depends upon why you're wanting
the record to be deleted - if it is just cleaning up old cruft, then it
doesn't matter at all - but those aren't all of the reasons that people
wanted this ability.

More seriously, something has to deal with the possibility that the
primary server might no longer be functioning at the time the deletion
is supposed to happen - another server might have replaced it.

In any case, all of this means that any kind of automated RR deletion
doesn't work, and really can't be made to work reliably in the DNS as
we know it (some different protocol set might have different outcomes,
but aren't relevant).

Because of that, if records are to be deleted, there really needs to be
something else that is going to take on the responsibility of making
sure that it actually happens, because even if the DNS is attempting to
do it, it isn't always going to be successful.

Then, once you accept the need for such an agent, any argument for having
the DNS do any of it simply vanishes - if the agent is able to clean up
in the hard cases, it can do so in the easy ones as well.

This has been a (very brief) summary of my recollection of the discussions
that took place in the DNSIND working group (the predecessor to dnsext)
when dynamic updates was being designed.   I think I have it more or less
complete - but do feel free to go back and check ancient namedroppers
archives (sometime mid 90's this would have been I think, look a year or two
before the date of the dynamic updates doc - maybe a bit more, that doc
was done and sat for ages waiting for a security mechanism to appear to
make it safe enough for anyone to use).   Namedroppers has been the list
for DNS development since before I was involved (that is, a very long time
now).  Just about everything should be in its archives...

A short question, and a long answer from Robert Elz, which I will refrain 
from repeating in its entirety here. I think this is the crux of the 
matter:

>The principle problem is not how one would manage to tell the
>primary server that the data was supposed to vanish, but how
>that server would pass along that information to secondary servers.

If I understand this correctly, Robert is saying that he believes:

(c) a garbage collection mechanism to purge old records would be nice,
    but it is simply not possible.

I would submit that the definition of "simply not possible" is merely a 
matter of where you choose to set your horizons.

If the usefulness of DNS UPDATE is fundamentally undermined by the lack 
of a garbage collection mechanism to purge old records, then we (the IETF 
community) should take on the challenge to solve that problem, not simply 
declare it impossible and give up. Just as DNS migrated from AXFR to IXFR 
over time, I see no reason it couldn't migrate from IXFR to some new 
thing ("IXFR2"?) which does provide the necessary garbage collection 
support to make DNS UPDATE a useful technology.

That's true, but ...

this isn't.

DNS UPDATE works just fine as it is, there are applications that manage
it just fine, and the lack of any internal mechanism in the DNS to make
old stuff go away doesn't bother those in the least.

However, of course, a false premise doesn't imply a false conslusion, so:

isn't necessarily false - just nothing above on its own would drive us to
this state.

What you really mean is that you have a use for DNS update, which doesn't
work well without a cleanup mechanism.   Of course, here, we all know that
I don't think much of that proposed use...

I have no doubt but that this could be made to work, with sufficient effort.
But do remember that when dnsind was looking at this, a lot of effort was
expended in exactly that direction, with precisely zero results.

Also, note that there is a considerable swell of background feeling that
it is getting close to the time to simply scrap the DNS, and invent DNS2.
Any proposal that starts to make major changes to how the DNS functions
is going to (I suspect) get pushback both from the people who simply
don't see the need, and from the people who agree to the need, but who
don't want to bother with yet another hack to the current DNS.

But whatever your feeling on this is, this WG is most certainly not the
place to be discussing this kind of DNS change - take to to the dnsext WG
(namedroppers@ops.ietf.org) where you will get a whole stack of DNS
people to comment.

ps: I do know about the draft that Bernard mentioned, as best I can tell,
it is going precisely nowhere.

Well, it doesn't do much for the humans who have to clean up after this.

Well, then maybe it's time to look at it again. The Internet is a rather
dynamic place, and what wasn't a good idea last year doesn't guarantee that
it's a bad idea this year

Oh great...just what we need,  moratorium on improving DNS because "The
Exciting New World of DNS2 Will Make It All Better"

Pardon my cynicism, but we need both. IPv6 hasn't yet replaced IPv4, but it
would have been foolish to not do anything to improve IPv4 while waiting for
IPv6. Get started on DNS2, but let's not sit on our hands in the meantime.

Well, actually, since DNS is central to Zeroconf, yes it is, if you think
about it. Besides, it's always better to propose a change that fixes a real
world problem, as opposed to a theoretical one.

As an alternative, perhaps we should be working on making "DNS"
less central to zeroconf.  It is certainly a possibility, if you
think about it.

Nothing was said about "bad ideas", what was said was that a suitable
method to make it work hadn't been found.   By all means, go ahead and
propose a solution to the problem.   If it works, lots of people will be
very happy.   Just don't expect people who already spend a lot of time
on this to do it for you - nor for them to be very sympathetic to ideas
that won't work (propose something unworkable and expect a very brusque
response).

That's fine - and incremental improvements are continually being made to
the DNS (as they are to IPv4).   But no-one rational would suggest making
a sweeping change that would involve upgrading everyone's IPv4 stack at
this stage of the game.   Improvements to the DNS will happen, and do
happen - major changes are starting to look less likely (but who can tell).

there's a good reason for that.  there are hundreds of millions of 
computers and tens of thousands of computer programs out there that
were designed to work with DNS as it is currently defined - not some
modified version of DNS with slightly different semantics and 
different failure modes.  

so by calling something *DNS* that doesn't act quite like DNS you're 
doing one (or both) of two things: (1) trying to gain credibility for your
proposal by exploiting the DNS name, or (2) threatening to break a huge
amount of installed software should it ever be expected to interoperate
with your alternation of DNS as if it were *real* DNS.

(c') DNS wasn't designed to do this, and it's very difficult to retro-fit 
it into DNS in a way that allows incremental upgrading of DNS servers.

How wide of a "community" should look into this?

Should there be a group of people elected to review this?  (other than 
the people on this list as a whole)

> How wide of a "community" should look into this?

well, when you start talking about changing DNS, you're threatening
to break every host and every application on the Internet.  

it's certainly not something within zeroconf's purview, and IMHO even
the *dns* groups should solicit wide review from apps area groups
before tampering with such things.  

fortunately, the *dns* groups have traditionally taken their 
responsibilities to avoid harm fairly seriously.  I can't say the
same for zeroconf.

Um...it's real irresponsible to make the zeroconf group out to be a bunch of
yahoos bent on destroying DNS. From everything I've read in the mDNS and
other papers, they've bent over backwards to avoid causing harm to DNS. Are
they updating it? Yes. Causing harm? Well, that's what things like the WG
and this mailing list are trying to deal with.

Luckily, as of August 24th, you're shortly going to have what is, without a
doubt, the best, and in the end, the only way to see if something really
works:

Real - world testing on a large scale.

I'm in the middle of setting up a domain that will, among other things start
implementing Zeroconf/Rendezvous along with conventional DNS, so I'll be
able to see in a reasonably real - world setting what works and what
doesn't.

hey, it's not just DNS - it's IP also :)

of course zeroconf isn't trying to destroy DNS, or IP.  
but neither does it seem to be very concerned about compatibility issues.

as for your supposed real-world testing, I don't think MIT can even
approach the diversity that exists in the internet.  So I'd consider
it useless.

IP has been serviceless for too long, and been the bane of the non-technical
users existance for just as long. If people really want to see things like
appliances on a network, then things like zeroconf are going to be a
requirement.

Have you read the specs? There's yards of verbiage that deals with
compatibility.

Well, okay, so I *only* have:

Solaris 8
AIX 4.3
AIX 5L
Linux
Windows 2000
Windows NT
Mac OS X 10.2
OS/400

Yep, you're absolutely right, no diversity at all. I still need a mainframe,
and OS/2 box, an SGI, two crays, an amiga, and a TRS-80 model III on dial
up.

But since at least I'm trying to contribute something besides deconstructive
criticism, I'm pretty happy with it over all.

YP (later NIS) did indeed break applications, and is one of the things 
that demonstrated to me that overloading of new services on existing 
interfaces was a dubious idea.   There are lots of examples:

- YP could return inconsistent results from DNS both in obvious ways
(different name-to-address bindings) and subtle ways (canonical name
for an address might be an FQDN in one case and not in another).
this could result in different hosts in a conversation having
different views of "DNS" (i.e. host name<>address mapping) and 
causing things to break in subtle ways.

- failure modes were different: a host could wait indefinitely on YP
binding when a DNS query would have timed out - this could cause 
failures for applications that were time-critical. (to some degree 
this was a result of overloading the gethostbyname interface to do 
DNS queries rather than local-file lookup - hence the clunky h_errno 
hack - which was at first only supported for DNS queries)

- capabilities were different: originally YP tried to completely substitute
for DNS, which meant that essential services like MX lookup were not 
available.    For many years Sun distributed two version of sendmail -
one with DNS/MX support and one which used only YP - the latter would
simply bounce mail for any domain that didn't have an A record (even
if it had an MX record).

of course, YP was deployed a long time ago, and at a time when the Internet
was much smaller than it is now - so the impact was much less than it would be
now.  and both applications and host implementations have adjusted since YP
was initially deployed.  for many years it was necessary to explicitly
link -lresolv to your applications in order to get the version of 
gethostbyname() that did DNS lookups. nowdays -lresolv might not actually 
redefine gethostbyname() to use DNS but the chances are good that the sysadmin 
has included "dns" in the nss switch file.  but to be sure you might have to
call the res_* routines explicitly if you really need DNS lookup. and modern 
implementations of NIS are probably better at setting h_errno to return 
similar error codes for similar conditions across different services.  but
even now, NIS is a potential source of DNS inconsistency from one host to 
another (producing problems similar to those produced by multi-faced DNS) 
and it's still possible for applications to get bitten by it.

one other important difference - NIS was never standardized.  we can't 
stop vendors from putting dubious features in products, but we shouldn't
bless such practices.  and yes, even though many of the problems
have been sorted out (if memory serves it took about 10 years for this 
to happen) using NIS for hostname lookup is *still* a dubious idea.
it mostly serves to increase the potential for errors, while adding
very little additional functionality - the chief benefit seems to be
that it provides a way to do the equivalent of two-faced DNS (which 
is also known to cause problems) in a more complex and error-prone fashion.


	you have been arguing that multicast DNS (or LLMNR) is bad as it mimics
	DNS behavior and breaks applications.  i would like to hear your
	comment about NIS and NIS+.  they are widely deployed, integrated
	into name resolution functionality of systems (gethostbyname), and
	certainly overrides DNS in NIS-configured network.

	from my experience, all NIS, NIS+ and multicast DNS work just fine,
	no problem observed.  if you are okay with NIS/NIS+, you should be
	okay with multicast DNS.

I'm hoping to find time to contribute more constructively (i.e. in more detail)
Unfortunately our process places the burden of doing detailed analysis on 
the people who raise objections, not (as normal engineering discipline would
dictate) on the people who make proposals.

This reads like an argument for careful review of mDNS/LLMNR to make sure
that the problems you cite are minimized.

I'd note that mDNS and LLMNR do have some important differences along
these dimensions.

Actually, it matters little whether the members of Zeroconf WG are
yahoos bent on destroying DNS, or angels sent from heaven to
save DNS -- because Zeroconf has no charter items relating to DNS.

DNSEXT WG has the responsibility of destroying (or saving) DNS.

> hey, it's not just DNS - it's IP also :)

There is indeed a work item relating to IP (IPv4 linklocal), but not DNS.

yes, that's what I expect should be done - while also considering the 
possibility that it might be better to abandon the approach altogether.

A New Internet-Draft is available from the on-line Internet-Drafts
directories.
This draft is a work item of the DNS Extensions Working Group of the IETF.

	Title		: Linklocal Multicast Name Resolution (LLMNR)
	Author(s)	: L. Esibov, B. Aboba, D. Thaler
	Filename	: draft-ietf-dnsext-mdns-12.txt
	Pages		: 20
	Date		: 2002-8-27

Today, with the rise of home networking, there are an increasing number
of ad-hoc networks operating without a DNS server. In order to allow
name resolution in such environments, Link-Local Multicast Name
Resolution (LLMNR) is proposed. LLMNR supports all current and future
DNS formats, types and classes, while operating on a separate port from
DNS, and with a distinct resolver cache.

true, but some of the proposals originated here, and this group seems
to have the assumption that changing how DNS works is part of the
solution space for what this group is trying to achieve - even if someone
else has to do it.

Some in this group may be operating under that assumption -- but the IESG
in its wisdom did not vest that power in the Zeroconf WG.

Instead, they vested it in the WG that owns responsibility for DNS -
namely DNSEXT WG.

The DNSEXT WG reviewed the mDNS proposals that originated here -- and
so far has chosen not to grant them standards track status.

They did however, originate their own proposal, and put it on the
standards track in DNSEXT WG. This is the LLMNR draft.

the existence of one source of error does not justify introducing another.

it wasn't just a difference in the delay before timing out, it was
a difference in the way errors were reported.  and under some conditions
(ypbind failure) YP lookups would not time out at all.

after lots of pulling our hair out we decided that "correct" configuration
of NIS was to completely disable it for hostname lookups (even when that
meant patching libc.so).   we've had very few problems with it since then :)  

(though not zero - I remember one problem that resulted from 
getservbyname ("smtp", "tcp") returning NULL due to a ypbind failure.  
it makes *zero* sense to use a network-based service to look up a well-known 
constant.  I replaced that line with htons(25) and it's worked fine ever since :)

I was all set to put this before the IESG when I realized that the
IETF Last Call was run all the way back in July of last year. Given
the length of time that has elapsed, I opted to run the LC again. Once
the LC has completed, I will formally put the document before the IESG
as a whole.

In re-reviewing the document, I had the following comments:

Most are nits. The one substantive comment is:

   If the destination address is in the 169.254/16 prefix (including the
   169.254.255.255 broadcast address), the host SHOULD use its link-
   local source address, if it has one. If the host does not have a
   link-local source address, then it MAY choose to ARP for the
   destination address and then send its packet, with a routable source
   IP address and a link-local destination IP address, directly to its
   destination on the same physical link. The host MUST NOT send the
   packet to any router for forwarding.

The above wording suggests that if host has no LL address, it is not
required to use its global address to talk to a device that only has a
LL address. This seems broken (i.e, will result in communication
failure that is hard to diagnose). Seems to me that SHOULD->MUST and
the MAY should also be a MUST.

nits:

The Security considerations should mention the trivial DOS attack
whereby an attacker can force a node to give up its address. This is
discussed in the document, so the security considerations could just
point to that text.

Perhaps Change title to "Usage of and Dynamic Configuration of IPv4 LL Addresses"?

>   addresses in the source or destination address. With respects to

   being probed. An ARP request constructed this way with an all-zero
   'sender IP address' is referred to as an "ARP probe".

term was already defined earlier.

actually I wouldn't claim that at all - quite the opposite. I think we need 
lots of mechanisms for host-to-address lookup, service-to-address lookup,
resource-to-address lookup.

but DNS *is* the one true mechanism for lookup of DNS names :)

no, all I need to prove is that we have an installed base that is dependent
on the APIs that are used to do DNS lookup having DNS semantics.  whether
those semantics are right or wrong is immaterial if changing them will break
applications.

        as i have wrote repeatedly, use of multicast DNS did not break any
        applications for me.  if you have evidence that it actually broke
        your applications, you have to tell us the details so that we can fix
        things.  if you are making discussion based on armchair theory,
        i suggest you to speak up again only after trying it out for real.


that's just completely wrong.   you analyze the design *before* you 
deploy it widely.  experience with implementation and early deployment 
tells you whether the specification was precise enough, and whether
you have any unforseen problems (or benefits). it does NOT tell you
a number of other things - such as the impact on operations of existing
applications or networks, the degree to which it scales, or whether it
affects security.

for any new technology that affects an existing service, this idea 
of "you have to prove it's broken to stop it" is broken.  the burden 
needs to be on the proposers to demonstrate - certainly by analysis,
perhaps also by operational testing - that the proposal will not have 
a disruptive effect.

Keith,

	I understand that you believe the above.  However, the IETF process
does NOT require that the burden is 100% on the proposers.  As this is
an IETF WG, your preferred approach is not the same as the actual
ground rules in place here.

	Moreover, as Bernard has pointed out, you're raising your issue in
the wrong WG anyway.

understood.  IMHO it's a change that is badly needed.
of course, this isn't the right group to discuss *that* either.

I noticed that dnsext has just revised the mdns draft so I'll comment 
on that draft to the dnsext mailing list.

It's a bunch of people using their network, not students. We are going 
to be testing student labs as well.

*Obviously* any test isn't going to perfectly mirror the internet. But 
testing in a real world situation, as opposed to an artificially 
created lab is a good way to find odd things that could go wrong.

well, at least someone's testing something somewhere. It's the best way 
to find real, as opposed to perceived problems.

two questions:

1)	Have you done a careful review?

2)	What do you propose in Zeroconf's place?

<sigh>...which is why we need to TEST this, and get real data that can 
be verified, and duplicated. Otherwise, all of this is just arguing 
about angels doing the gavotte on sewing hardware.

Actually, test deployments are part of testing. You cannot get a 
thorough or reliable analysis without real-world testing. That does NOT 
mean you deploy it across 50,000 machines on tuesday and see what 
happens. But you aren't going to get squat for reliable data on 
scaling, security, operational impact until you actually try it.

Because paper can be wrong...which is why the C-124 was the bumblebee 
of cargo planes.

Analysis alone is never enough. On paper, lots of things look good. But 
you *need* operational testing to look at silly things like 
implementation details. Theoretical analysis can only go so far. At 
some point, someone's got to fire it up.

My airplane has a design max speed of 171 miles per hour.  This figure is 
based on analysis of the airframe structure and measured strength of the 
materials used in its construction.  However, it will probably go faster 
than that before it falls completely apart - both because there is some
design margin to account for slight variation in materials and wear over 
time, and because the analysis techniques used when the airframe was 
designed could not exactly predict fatigue under all flight conditions.

Why don't you get an airplane like mine (I want to keep the one I own), 
take it up to its ceiling (about 12,500 feet), push the throttle forward 
and nose down, and TEST it to see when it fails?

Testing on live users and networks is no substitute for analysis.

didn't say it was.  but there are far more cases that you can analyze
than those you can test.  you need the tests to verify your analysis,
not to verify your design.

        so what's bad about trying things out in real life?

nothing.  but we also need to recognize that it has its limitations.

also, the internet is a lot bigger place than it used to be.  
what was "good enough" in the mid-1980s when there were tens of
thousands of users on the net and nearly everyone on the
net ran some kind of BSD isn't necessarily good enough now.

as for the perils of trying things out in real life, I keep 
thinking of the Tacoma Narrows Bridge, which was built in spite
of analysis that showed that it would fail under wind loads.

So is there some analysis (something other than pure speculation) that 
shows that IPv4 link local addresses or mDNS or NAIS will wreck havoc? 
I haven't seen anything yet, with the exception of issues with 
multihomed hosts and IPv4 link-local addresses.

tell me - do you think that that software devleopers want their products
to act differently depending on whether they're run at utk.edu or itojun.org?

I'm in the middle of doing detailed analysis on LLMNR - so I'll refrain
from making detailed comments until that's done.  And I'll make those 
comments to the dnsext WG.

Yes, there are several problems with IPv4 LL, many of which I've described
in detail in comments to this WG and to the IESG.  No they are not 
addressed in the current draft.  I'm working on the analysis for LLMNR. 
Yes, there are problems with it also - descriptions are forthcoming.

The military does this all the time...they're called test pilots for a 
reason. You'll note they find all kinds of things the design didn't 
point out. This is how we discover all kinds of interesting things 
about the limits of an airframe..sometimes unintentionally...like the 
B-52 that survived a barrel roll...or that a KC-135R model can climb at 
a 70 Degree angle with no real problems.

The real world hits you with variables you can't predict, which is 
where a paper-only test fails miserably. Paper testing helps you deal 
quickly with the predictable issues, so you can focus real world 
testing on the odd things humans do.

It's not *supposed* to be a *substitute. They work *together*. Either 
alone is *useless* because you miss too much overly relying on a single 
method. Both together shore up each other's weaknesses and provide a 
picture of what you are testing that *neither* can ever provide on 
their own.

which is why the intelligent tester uses both methods.

they do both in the end, analysis can't cover everything. Reality is

Deliberate stupidity cancels everything out. on paper, a B-1B's ECM 
system is a snap to maintain, 200+ *easily replaceable" units....the 
reality is quite different, but for reasons you couldn't predict 
without doing the replacing.

So far, I see no evidence that this will happen other than vague

I had in fact carefully reviewed an earlier version of mdns;
I just hadn't read it recently.  So it was possible that the problems
had been fixed.  But they haven't.

frankly I think it would be more constructive if people would actually try to 
address the technical problems with their proposals rather than claim that they
don't exist and to malign the person who points them out.

truly, analysis can fail, just as testing can fail.  but it's certainly
appropriate to use analysis before you widely deploy something,
particularly something that changes the functionality of a widely-used
service.

my understanding is that properly done, a barrel roll is a 1G maneuver.  
so I see no reason any sufficiently powered aircraft couldn't survive it 
as long as its engines, fuel system, etc could handle the brief inverted 
operation.  it won't stress the airframe.

but I certainly agree that testing and analysis are both useful, and
that both are often necessary.  my beef is with the idea that testing 
alone is sufficient when the potentail for disruption (and the associated 
cost) are high.

I, and a lot of people, simply want *proof* of these problems...yes or 
no. So far, we haven't been able to test them. All the criticism has 
been "may" or "could" or "might", but until someone can say "did" and 
"does", then we *don't know for sure*.

Which is why real, physical testing of potential problems is needed. 
Otherwise, we knife something based on theory. That would be an even 
greater waste of time.

There is a difference between testing deplyoments and production 
deployments. I agree that revamping anything for Zeroconf right now 
would be immature. *But*...I also think radically changing or dumping 
Zeroconf based on what is almost entirely theory would be just as 
immature. So you test the potential problems. *That* way, you have 
real, reproducible hard data. You can argue theory, you can argue 
analysis. It's real hard to argue with :

"If you set this system up under these parameter, it does the following 
bad things..."

As well, if you have real, hard data from real testing, then you make 
it *far* easier to implement spec changes in a methodical, coherent 
fashion.


Never ignore analysis, but don't insist that it's a substitute for 
firing up the system either.

Actually, in the B-52's case, the spine of the aircraft looked like a 
human spine...the pilot almost lost control of his bladder when he saw 
it. Went from 20-30,000 feet to 1,000 feet...B-52's aren't designed for 
that at all...

I've never advocated denying analysis for testing. Nor have I advocated 
breaking things for testing. Plan the test and test the plan.

nope.  you've got it backwards.  when you're trying to standardize 
technologies that change how IP and DNS work - i.e. two of the three 
most critical parts of Internet technology - the burden needs to be on 
the proposers to analyze the risks and persuasively argue that the
changes you are propsing will not cause harm to existing infrastrucutre
or applicatoins.  mere testing is unpersuasive because it cannot even 
begin to cover the conditions that will be encountered in the real world.

no, the greater waste of time is trying to fix problems caused by 
irresponsible widespread deployment of poorly-analyzed technology.

	from the recent measurement results made against lame delegation, TTL
	misconfiguration and such, i don't believe DNS behavior is analyzed
	well enough (it is still a mistery why it works this well).
	so if i follow your logic you need to remove DNS from your
	infrastructure.  you have to type in IP addresses in numeric form :-P

Sigh...so in other words, since you cannot cover 100% of every 
situation, then we should sit on our hands and never test anything 
again, but rely on the perfect and complete accuracy of theoretical 
analysis...which gave us such great and widely implemented protocols 
like OSI.

According to your logic, nothing should be done anywhere unless every 
possible contingency can be accounted for. So no more software updates, 
because you cannot predict and test for every single situation. No more 
new hardware, you cannot predict and test for every situation. What the 
heck, we didn't need anything more than what we have now anyway. 
Obviously any work on dns and TCP/IP should be immediately halted until 
a 100% guarantee can be made that all possible problems have been 
predicted and corrected.

Pardon me if I think that this is of course, silly. Obviously we cannot 
build a replica of the internet. But if enough people test in different 
situations, we get a good sample that will minimize the unpredictable. 
Murphy's law is not a theory.

I don't expect that any testing will be 100% effective. But in 
combination with analysis, it will be *really* close.

Um...have you read anything I've written? I said *testing* not 
*production deployment*. I really fail to understand why you think that 
testing and analysis are mutually exclusive, and that testing and 
production are not..

no, it doesn't follow.
for better or worse, DNS is already deployed, and people depend on it.

the fact that DNS is already deployed doesn't justify deploying other 
things that change how DNS or IP operates, for which there is plenty of
reason to suspect that they will break applications, and for which 
analysis provides no reason to be confident that they will not break
applications.

No, that's not what I said, and your interpretation of it is unwarranted.

But if you can't even interpret plain English text then you are obviously 
incapble of performing analysis on a technical protocol specification.
Hence, further discussion along these lines with you is futile.

If people continually misinterpret you, maybe you should make an effort 
to be more concise and precise in your language.

You *said*:

"mere testing is unpersuasive because it cannot even begin to cover the 
conditions that will be encountered in the real world."

which of course no one has advocated.

you've also *said*:

"as for your supposed real-world testing, I don't think MIT can even 
approach the diversity that exists in the internet.  So I'd consider it 
useless."

now, it's not unreasonable to derive from these statements that you 
seem to think that if you cannot test for *everything* and *anything*, 
then testing is useless and shouldn't even be attempted.

I, nor anyone else has advocated testing without analysis, although you 
have continually acted as though we have. If you aren't listening to 
anyone who disagrees with you is saying, then you're right, further 
discussion is futile.

yes it is unreasonable to derive that,  because that's not what was said.
what I said was that you need to do analysis about possible failure modes, 
and that the kinds of tests that are done need to be driven by the
analysis - not by merely deploying it somewhere and seeing if it works. 

something that I didn't say (but which I believe) is that testing can reveal 
failures that weren't disclosed by analysis, but that the failure of a 
test to demonstrate a flaw doesn't necessarily mean that the analysis that 
said there was a flaw was wrong - since you usually can't provide sufficient 
test coverage.

> I, nor anyone else has advocated testing without analysis

perhaps not, but I haven't seen any attempt to actually *do* the analysis.

Hello John,

I've read most of the volumes of discourse on this, trying to
see all sides.  I'd be interested in your short answers to
these questions:

- Is there any non-DNS solution that would make sense to you?

- Do you agree that name resolution is qualitatively different
  than service resolution?

- Could you imagine changing SLP in some way to fit the
  needs as you perceive them?  If so, then why isn't that
  a better idea than changing DNS?

- Is anyone contending that zeroconf (per se) is itself
  harmful?  I hope not, but some of the messages seem to
  be ambiguous on this point.

My idea on analysis vs. testing, by the way, is that both
are crucial.  And I thought everyone agreed on that.
Unfortunately, it's totally easy to find examples where
one or the other was omitted, and success still happened.
It's also possible to find examples where one was omitted,
and blame consequent failure on that.  It's also possible
to find examples where analysis indicates "failure" and
yet success still happens (maybe NAT as an example), but
because somehow the costs shown by analysis are not
perceived as outweighing the benefits.  Maybe even
the costs are cumulative and the customers do not somehow
mind until it's too late (consider the parable of the
lobster in the cooking pot).  The point of this rambling
paragraph is that the debate can go on forever without
conclusion because both sides have ample evidence that
they're correct because they are both close enough to
being correct.

Regards,
Charlie P.

I *never* said "Just deploy it and see if it works". I said test it and 
see how the analysis really works, and get some real, as opposed to 
theoretical data. If there's something broke, testing will quickly 
reveal it, and likely give you a better idea of how to fix it.

Then design a test to beat on a theoretical flaw. If analysis shows a 
likely problem, you can test for that.

Um...right. Everyone here has just advocated blindly implementing 
Zeroconf as is, with no testing or analysis whatsoever.

So far, no. I haven't seen hide nor hair of one that would be 
implementable across the range of platforms and work in a predicable, 
usable fashion.

It depends on how you look at it. If you mean that service resolution 
has to return all possible capabilities of a device, then yes.

However, if all you want are a list of names of things that do <task>, 
then not really. And so far, the best, and most useful implementations 
of service discovery return names of things that print, share files, 
etc. So, based on that, and the fact that humans look for things by 
name, not capabilities, then name resolution is the best way to go for 
service resolution. And we already have a name resolution system, that 
on paper, is unwieldy, kludgy, limited, yadda, yadda....but, it works, 
it works well, and I have yet to see any hard data of any sort from any 
naysayer that shows how Zeroconf is going to somehow globally pooch 
DNS. I'm going to test it on my own, and see how things actually work. 
If more people take what little analysis has been done, test that, add 
to the valid list of what is good and bad, then we will quickly get a 
valid idea of the way to refine and implement, or not implement 
Zeroconf.

I first have to imagine an implementation of SLP that isn't so poor as 
to be unusable., and it has to be usable on more than three platforms. 
So far, *maybe* Novell has a usable SLP implementation. Apple's is file 
sharing only and sucks. Sun's is too complex to be taken widely usable, 
and therefore isn't. It doesn't exist as far as Microsoft is concerned. 
It's a great protocol, but the designers completely pooched 
implementation, and in fact, Apple is *dropping* SLP anyway. So none of 
the two majority desktop systems really support SLP anymore. Maybe if 
implementation  and testing had mattered as much as theory, we wouldn't 
need to have this argument.

As far as SLP itself goes? It's too complicated. It tries to do too 
much, and in doing so, works really poorly on the platforms that it 
works at all on. Engineerspeak aside, humans just want a list of 
printers, servers, etc. near them. Name the printers well, and you're 
golden. People just want a list of stuff that does what they need with 
meaningful names. Unless you get that, you are going to be barking up 
the wrong tree forever.

I just think that any idea that gets to the point where it can be 
tested should be. Theory is good, analysis is good, but in the end, 
testing data is still better, and in concert, all three give you the 
best data.

I haven't seen anything else either. Why would we want to invent 
another protocol to work for an unconfigured network when one that is 
already out there will work so well?

DNS stands for Domain Name System right? Was it ever stated that DNS is 
really just a Domain Host Name System. What is the difference in using 
DNS to name services in addition to hosts. They're all just named RRs.

SLP could be changed, but the degree of change required to make SLP 
work appears to be a lot more effort that just using what already 
exists in DNS. In addition, the effort to get SLP deployed appears to 
be much more work than DNS. DNS doesn't need to change to support 
finding services, all of the necessary RRs and infrastructure are 
already there. DNS-NIAS does not require any changes to the DNS 
protocol, it is just a usage model. There are no additional RRs 
required. There are no changes required of servers. There are no 
changes required of the client, though libraries that give application 
developers a simpler API than res_query would make things a lot easier. 
It is not at all clear how DNS-NIAS would lead to the meltdown of the 
internet as one on this list has so passionately argued would happen.

I think you're missing the point that it is useless to test unless
you have some idea what to test for.

Basic operation under ordinary circumstances is fine - but also easy.
Other than in the wildest circumstances, if someone can look at a
protocol and believe it will work (which its author at least generally
does) then it is probably close enough that if you just turn in on
it will "work".    Testing to see that is a waste of time (and you usually
get plenty of it anyway, as a side effect, while shaking out implementation
bugs, as distinct from protocol bugs).

To achieve anything worthwhile, you have to know what to test for.
That is, you look at the protocol, and you're suspicious that it doesn't
scale well, so you test a very large installation, and see what happens.
Or you look at the protocol, and are suspicious that it won't work well
if responses are slow, so you stick it on a slow server on a very heavily
loaded network, with a long RTT, and see.   Or you are suspicious that it
won't do well if there's heavy packet loss, so you ...

But just "try it and see if it works ok for me" kind of testing is
completely useless for our purposes.   It is just fine if your aim
is to decide whether to use the thing or not yourself, but not if
the aim is (as ours is here) to recommend to others that they use it.

This is total nonsense.    If an idea is a poor one, then that is
what it is, whether or not there's an alternative.

Sometimes, pressing need, and the lack of an alternative might drive
one to accept a poor idea.  But it is still a poor idea,  it doesn't
become better just because people are forced into using it.

IPv6 is a good example of that. It can be expensive to blindly accept poor ideas.

PARIS Europe's bold hopes for third-generation mobile-phone services have come crashing down to earth. By one estimate, perhaps half
of the licenses that West European companies bought two years ago for fast networks will never be used - meaning $50 billion will
have been spent for nothing."

It doesn't mean a poor idea isn't poor. But if you're going to spend 
the time to blast away at any idea, then it's far more constructive to 
spend just as much time trying to come up with a better way to solve 
the problem.

Of course...but at the moment, we *do* have things to test for:

1)	Interaction with current DNS setups
2)	Interaction with current network addressing setups
3)	Interaction with current security setups
4)	Interaction with current services

I've no doubt that you can get basic operation out of anything. You 
test to see what happens when you beat on it. When you do 'cool' things 
with it. When you do silly things with it. When you do deliberately 
stupid things to it. When you let people who *aren't* network geeks at 
it.

The idea is to get a *lot* of people testing it in different setups, to 
probe for faults and bugs, to see how it holds up under the infinite 
varieties of what we call 'normal' use. And *abnormal use*, whatever 
that means.

I'm working to see what happens when you get a *lot* of people banging 
on it, how well it holds up, what the network does, etc.

there are already very obvious things to test for, and as the analysis 
continues, we'll get more things to test for. And Zeroconf will either 
become better, or it will be obvious that it isn't going to work. But 
you won't know for sure with *just* testing, or *just* analysis. You 
*have* to have both.

Thank you for bringing this to our attention.
There are several problems with this text.

ZeroConf is not a standard (yet).

This language is not consistent with the fact that the IETF is not
composed of company representatives, but individual contributors.

How can it be "first documented" when there is no RFC yet?
Internet Drafts are explicitly not to be referenced. 

    Rendezvous is Apple's implementation of the ZeroConf standard 
    documented by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF), 
    the group responsible for defining Internet standards. 

    First documented in the late 1990s by the IETF and sponsored 
    by Apple, Rendezvous is a zero configuration technology that 
    brings together Internet IP standards and LAN networks.

> Very great idea !

very bad idea - this will propagate buggy protocols that isn't yet up 
to standards-track quality.

actually I have no problem with distributing code for use on an 
experimental basis as long as people are aware that the protocols
are subject to change - I think it's very unfortunate that this code
is in shipping production products.

	Since it works just fine, I'm sure glad that it is
running in my laptop today (and not at some future decade
when IETF gets its process unwedged)...

	Oh, and Apple is to be commended for making their
source code available.  Thanks also to Stuart Cheshire,
who no doubt had some hand in this happening...

a bit of analysis shows that that's not necessarily true. 

if a proposal will do harm if propagated, then any effort which results
in minimizing and/or delaying the harm done is well spent.

on the other hand, a half-baked competing proposal - even one which has 
the kernel of a better idea buried in it - is often little better than 
no proposal.  sometimes it is worse, because an apparently-complete 
proposal (even if it is based on a bad idea) may seem to compare favorably 
with an incomplete one (even if it is based on a good idea).  this is 
usually a fallacy based on failure to compare both proposals with
respect to the same set of requirements, but it's a mistake that is 
commonly made.

> But you won't know for sure with *just* testing, or *just* analysis.

but you do not need to have all of your analysis verified by testing,
or vice versa.  analysis and testing tend to cover different cases -
you learn from each of them, but you can only use one to verify the
other when they overlap.

for instance, there's no practical way to test the effect of zeroconf
protocols on the wide variety of applications and wide variety of
network configurations that are out there.  the most test coverage you
can hope for is to try it with the applications you use normally and 
on a few specific network configurations.  that's not even a drop in the
bucket.

ah, but it *doesn't* work just fine - it just hasn't broken when
you tried it - at least not in a way that you noticed.

I do appreciate their giving the code away - it makes it more likely
that there will be free implementations of the fixed version of zeroconf
once we get the protocols fixed.  The problem is in misleading the public
that this is a robust protocol.

I think this is a great experiment that the zeroconf group should 
follow.

Think of it, suddenly there is a base of over 100,000 (Apple Press 
Release on monday stating they had sold 100,000 copies over the 
weekend, not counting the sell out of 10.2 in England)  users who have 
this implementation of zeroconf running on their systems.  Granted not 
everyone will be using it immediately, but they will over time.

I think Apple, by releasing their source code, is making a gesture that 
they want a speedier process, and want others (like printer 
manufacturers) to get up to speed quicker.

Now Keith may think this is a very BAD idea, I know.  Keith is very 
important in this process, you always need a Keith around to be the 
real Devils-Advocate to ensure we really dont do anything stupid.  But 
in the end, you need to draw a line in the sand, and jump.......good 
bad, right or wrong.....

Keith,

	If you'd spent the time doing analysis this week,
instead of blathering on the wrong IETF mailing list,
you might have actually been able to generate a list
of technical problems you perceive.

	Its rather a pity that you preferred to send high
volumes of repetitive non-technical email rather than
spend the time doing the analysis you seem to think is
required.

	Sigh.

Keith,

	Please send a formal proof that it is broken.

	Until then, I will continue to believe that you have
NO DATA, NO ANALYSIS, and NO CLUE what you are blathering about.
No amount of ongoing random whiney non-substantive email from you
is going to change what the rest of the world thinks.  You get
no points for volume of irrelevant email either.

you know, if I said "hey, I've got an idea for a new TCP extension that 
allows it to optimize for short request/replys in two packets" then I
*know* I'd get serious pushback on that because it's been known (via
analysis) for decades that you need at least five packets to do that 
reliably - at least, for the set of assumptions in which TCP is 
expected to operate.  arguments of the form "hey, it works when I try it"
would fall on deaf ears - I'd be expected to either provide proof that
the earlier work was incorrect or to show that I'm exploiting a 
useful case for which the original analysis did not apply.  And I'd
consider that entirely reasonable.

on the other hand, when the zeroconf folks say "hey, we can redefine
IP to work differently than applications expect, and we can also redefine
DNS to work differently than applications expect, and it won't break
anything - we tried it and it works for us!"  then people say 
"hey, what a wonderful thing this is!  isn't it nice that [vendor] is 
shipping it in product without bothering to do either analysis of the
probable failure modes or waiting for the bugs to be worked out!"

that's essentially what they said about the Tacoma Narrows Bridge -
we don't believe your wind analysis because you can't formally prove it.

Ran, 

As I've said repeatedly I'm working on analysis of mDNS, but it's extremely 
time-consuming.

Furthermore, when members of this group clearly indicate that they're not 
capable of understanding analysis, that seems like a good indication that 
the analysis is a waste of time - at least for this audience.

Keith,

If you're going to send mail to the iab/iesg, you might want to at
least include context so folk there know what it is you are
complaining about and perhaps also indicate what should be done
instead. I suspect that most folk who read your note will recognize
that you are unhappy, but not have the foggiest why.

(Truth-in-advertising: I've been following the discussions on zeroconf
and am not completely sure what your specific issue is and I'd rather
not be guessing, given the range of discussion that has been taking place.)

Has the public been mislead about how robust IPv6 is ?

Has anyone seen how many changes have to be made to the BSD version of 6to4 to make it robust ?

noted.  I had hoped IESG would be more up on this WG especially since
it's trying to change the behavior of fundamental pieces of Internet 
infrastructure, but I certainly recognize that IESG folks never have 
enough time to cover everything that deserves scrutiny.

unfortunately I don't know how to include context without going into
lots of detail which is going to take more time both to write and to
read, and is going to have to wait until at least next week.

Still blathering by my measure.

There is nothing about the zeroconf proposals that "redefines IP to 
work differently than applications expect". An application that uses IP 
can continue to transparently do so with an IPv4 link local address 
without knowing the difference. Using a link-local IPv4 address does 
not change anything. It does create problems when using a multihomed 
host but most of those problems can be solved in the IP stack. The only 
problem that can't be solved in the stack is the ambiguity of an IPv4 
link local address that may exist on more than one interface. This can 
also be a problem with the use of private network address ranges. So 
does the benefit of using IPv4 link-local addresses outweigh the risks 
that people will have problems with multihoming? I think so.

You keep claiming that we're trying to "redefine DNS to work 
differently than applications expect". There are APIs that applications 
uses to access DNS, usually for the purpose of resolving a name to an 
address or an address to a name. Most applications know nothing about 
the actual implementation of DNS. Does an application care if a 
recursive query is done? No. Why should it care if a query is sent to 
the multicast address instead of a unicast address?

Keith,

	The main problem all along has been lack of specific technical details
in your emails that a reasonable person could review and understand.

IMNVHO, it really would be best if you did whatever work/analysis/other
you think is necessary, submerged while doing that, and resurfaced only
when you can put a specific technical issue in front of the ZeroConf WG
*for a proposal actually being handled within the ZeroConf WG*
(as different from being handled within DNSEXT WG, for example).

Thanks,

Ran
PS:	I've trimmed the distribution of my reply deliberately and quite 
substantially.

one problem with doing that is that it's very difficult for IESG to
push back on a group that thinks it has completed its work with 
little or no dissent.  people need to be reminded from time to time
that there are problems with the work so that they aren't completely
surprised when the detailed analysis does arrive.

The Golden Gate Bridge also experienced unexpected and disturbing
undulations after it was first opened in 1937, requiring retrofitting. In
1951 a violent storm swayed the bridge 27 ft side to side. Because of the
retrofits the bridge survived with only minor damage.

People of vision do their best and put something out there. It's never
perfect the first time 'round. Great ideas get refined by experience and
time in the real world. This next year is going to be an exciting one for
ZeroConf.

Keith,

How many times a day do you think is sufficient ?

Right now, it appears that you think the IESG needs hourly reminders.
Surely the IESG are more competent than that.  I know for certain
that they are already overly busy with real work (as different
from potential future work that isn't yet real).

Even if I bought your argument, which I don't since you haven't
made a *technical* argument yet, I'd think once a week would be
more than sufficient to make it clear that you are unhappy.

And I'm still wondering why you are spun up in ZeroConf about
a proposal that is being handled in a different WG (but, PLEASE,
don't explain that to me because I'm not really that interested).

John is of course right.

Zeroconf is NOT an IETF Standard (yet).

I apologize for any misinformation that may be being disseminated. 
However, while I can apologize for it, there is little I can do to stop 
it. I can't control what independent journalists write, and Apple's PR 
team doesn't like journalists talking to anyone but appointed Apple 
spokespersons, so I rarely get the chance to explain to those journalists 
the difference between an Internet Draft, Informational RFC, Proposed 
Standard RFC, etc.

I do try to keep Apple's own Web pages honest. For example, the marketing 
people insist on calling IPv4 Link-Local addressing an "industry 
standard" (because Apple and Microsoft have been shipping it in large 
volumes for over four years) but I don't let them call it an "IETF 
Standard", because it is not.

It will also help get any bugs in the code fixed. It will also help it 
get looked at by a wide range of eyes and expertise. That is *a good 
thing*

Well, the world doesn't have time to wait for more arguing over the 
concept. We have work to do, and this will help it get done.

You still get better results from both, and unverified analysis is

Actually, *so far* it does work fine. If it only breaks in unnoticeable 
ways, then it's not broken at any level that we care about.

unless it breaks something real, in a repeatable fashion, it's a 'what 
if'. you can always 'what if' something to the grave.

Prove it's not robust, since you've made the accusation. Show me 
something it's *actually* broke. Not theoretically broke, not may break 
some day. Show me something it's actually broken, and document it so it 
can get fixed.

Good analysis always is, as is good testing.

Dude, you show me a balanced, objective, repeatable analysis that shows 
proof that Zeroconf will break stuff, and I will stand right next to 
you and demand it gets fixed.

The only thing this group appears to be not capable of is taking vague 
'chicken little' warnings with no proof seriously. Screaming "bad 
things may happen" is not analysis.

That was one case, and they were dumb to ignore the analysis.

*However*, at least in that case, there was an analysis to ignore. You 
have yet to provide an analysis of any kind.

I can also point to quite a few things where analysis said it wouldn't 
work, yet it did, and well. Aeronautics is full of them. I for one am 
glad that the Wright brothers tested ideas as well as analyzed them.

remember...studied analysis said you couldn't fly faster than the speed 
of sound.

You've listed an encyclopedia's worth of vague warnings about the end
