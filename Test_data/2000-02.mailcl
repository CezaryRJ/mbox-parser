Hi folks,

I just subscribed to IETF ZeroConf WG and found a problem:

I just visited your email archives and noticed that my
original note (below) was never forwarded on the ZeroConf
list - don't know why - I never got a non-delivery notice.

The original note below is partially 'old news'.  Since
then, the IETF IPP WG has finished their final review of
the SLP 'printer:' template and I've sent the final edits
to the Internet-Drafts editor (yesterday).

I've appended my release note yesterday to the foot of this
message.  Comments are always welcome, but the IETF IPP WG
reached concensus that it was time to register the 1.0 version
of SLP 'printer:' and move on.

Cheers,
- Ira McDonald (consulting architect at Sharp Labs America

Subject: IPP> Service Location for printers - SLP template review


Hi Zeroconf folks,                    Wednesday (19 January 2000)

I've just been reading with pleasure the newest (10 January 2000)
Zeroconf Requirements, draft-ietf-zeroconf-reqts-02.txt.  The 
references to SLPv2 (RFC 2608) and printer discovery scenarios
led me to forward for your comments the following:

    draft-ietf-svrloc-printer-scheme-04.txt
    - Definition of 'printer:' URLs for use with SLP 
      (21 October 1999)

The abstract 'printer:' service template will be registered with IANA
in the very near future.  I did the October 1999 updates to align
the template with the final texts of the IPP/1.1 (Internet Printing
Protocol v1.1) from June 1999 which are 'standards track' (IPP/1.0
is Experimental, largely because it overloaded 'http:' URLs rather
than using a dedicated 'ipp:' URL).

The IETF IPP WG is now doing a final review of the SLP 'printer:'
template.  Harry Lewis (IBM) and I are currently collaborating to
translate the SLP 'printer:' template to an equivalent LDAP schema,
also for IANA registration, following the procedures in:

    draft-ietf-svrloc-template-conversion-05.txt
    - Conversion of LDAP Schemas to and from SLP Templates
      (22 October 1999)

Comments on the choice of template attributes from you folks would
be very welcome.  Please send comments to 'ipp@pwg.org'.

Note that, in accordance with IETF SLP WG philosophy, we have *not*
included state/status attributes (because they are too volatile and
would therefore cause re-registration storms in SLP).

Comments received by mail by next Wednesday morning, will be reviewed
at the regular IETF IPP WG Telecon:

Time:     26 January 2000 10:00-12:00 US PST (1:00-3:00 US EST)

Hi folks,                                       Monday (31 January 2000)

I've just sent the final version of 'Definition of the Printer Abstract
Service Type' to the Internet-Drafts editor and posted a shadow copy on
the PWG server at:

ftp://ftp.pwg.org/pub/pwg/ipp/new_SLP/draft-ietf-svrloc-printer-scheme-05.tx
t


Erik - please register this 'printer:' template with IANA - thanks.
Carl-Uno Manros (chair IETF IPP WG) wants this 'printer:' template
registered with IANA as soon as possible.

All changes from the previous (October 1999) draft are based on IETF IPP
WG reviews Wednesday (12 January 2000) and Wednesday (26 January 2000).

Harry Lewis (IBM) and I are working on an LDAP schema translation of
this template (following James Kempf's SLP to LDAP conversion spec).

>By the strict definition in the doc now, such a network would be

That is precisely the point I am raising. Right now, the draft says:

>A Zeroconf network is a network that at some point in time has
>one or more Zeroconf protocols.

I'm starting to wonder how useful this definition is. Under this 
definition you can call a network a "Zeroconf network" even if it is 
currently using no ZC protocols at all, just as long as at it ran at 
least one of the Zeroconf protocols, however briefly, sometime in the 
past.

I wonder how much sense that will make to people outside the Working 
Group. I'm sure that's not what they have in mind when they think of 
setting up a Zeroconf network. Perhaps we should talk about a "pure 
Zeroconf network" as one running Zeroconf protocols in all of the four 
areas we are discussing (Figures 1 and 2), and a "hybrid Zeroconf 
network" as one currently running at least one Zeroconf protocol (Figures 
3 and 4).

I think this is a *VERY* good question, which needs discussion.

I must admit that I had assumed that ZEROCONF would use two complementary 
but disjoint mechanisms: Something like net 169.254 claim-and-defend for 
purely link-local (non-routable) addresses, and DHCP server-assigned 
addresses for all larger scope (routable) addresses.

However, Myron points out a viable alternative, which is to say that the 
ZEROCONF WG does NOT endorse DHCP as the recommended configuration 
mechanism for routed networks, but instead recommends a different 
mechanism whereby a host discovers the network numbmer and then uses 
claim-and-defend to grab addresses at will on that (sub)network.

Or, we could say that ZEROCONF hosts are required to implement all three 
configuration mechanisms.

Comments?

We should have the requirements draft done in within a month. Do you think
you can produce an "autonet" RFC in a month???

I think the rules are that it is okay to reference an I-D as long as it is
clearly labeled as "a work in progress".

Stuart,

Thanks for taking the time to read the draft so carefully and to make such
detailed comments!! Personally, I prefer the comments get posted to the list
to avoid surprising anyone and to start building consensus sooner instead of
later. 

Please send future emails to myron.hattig@intel.com.

I think section 2 says this, but the abstract/intro may need some work.

Just to let you know I'm working a AutoNet related draft also. It allows
auto-addressing across multiple IP subnets. I'm calling it AutoNet++. We
have already implemented it on Linux. ;-)  Regardless of either of our
drafts, I'm hesitant to change the reqmts draft for a couple of reasons.

First, AutoNet is used as an example. People understand autonet, thus they
understand the example. If we change AutoNet to something else they will be
thinking about the something else instead of the purpose of the example.

Second, I don't want to appear to favor one solution over another. I've gone
to great pains to make this obvious to the reader and WG members. If I start
changing examples to use "new" protocols, I may appear to be favoring that
protocol. Right now the doc only uses examples published before summer 1999.

Your suggestion is true for all three case. In fact it is a common 
pre-requisite to any them. Also, the "host" must be prepared, not
the "protocol". How about this:

Hosts using ZEROCONF protocols must be prepared to reconfigure when the
network environment changes.  This is a general rule for all ZEROCONF
protocols. This requires a host using a Zeroconf protocol to transition in
three ways:
1. from a Zeroconf protocol to a non-Zeroconf protocol,
2. from a non-Zeroconf protocol to a Zeroconf protocol, and
3. a Zeroconf protocol must be able to re-initialize with possibly with new
   values.

Again, this is an example to illustrate a point. I'm not promoting any
particular protocol. If the example is changed to something the reader is
not familiar with, they will focus on the new protocol and miss the point of
the example. I think the text should remain unchanged.

Your wording is better so I'll use it, but I'll leave [Autonet].

Good catch!

I didn't think it mattered whether the point is made with a realistic or
non-realistic example. Since it may cause a distraction to the reader, I'll
change it.

Yours is better wording, I'll change it.

I'll add an FTP exmple that shows a person entering a name instead of IP
address then change "(and sometimes users)" to "and users". This will
clarify the point I was trying to make.

Good point. I'll change it to "A service is set of processes that speaks a

I'll fix the typo.

Agree. It will be deleted.

We're not trying to describe a peer-to-peer protocol. We are describing a
peer within serivce discovery. I almost left the definition out until seeing
it used in Erik's example, thus a definition was required. In the context of
a
service discovery protocol, I think the definition is accurate. I'd like to
hear more thoughts on this.

Again the context is service discovery not "network services". If a service
can't be found by a service discovery protocol, then it has no relevance
within the context of our discussion. I think the current definition is
okay.

This is a typo. Should have been "unsolicited".

True. It will be changed to your suggestion.

What is the benefit of the different example? Just seems like more work to

Is it that you don't understand the assumed requirements of using 
netmask and default route? OR 
Is it that there is no current ZC solution for the problem? 
Since I'm 99.99% sure that you understand the example and assumed
requirements ;-)

The source of the text comes from comments in our last meeting and on the
list from Matt Squire, Steve Deering, and others that hope to extend these
protocols into a multiple IP network solution some day. My understanding of
the group concensus is that no one wants to solve this problem today, but we
don't want to preclude a future solution. 

How about this:
Zeroconf protocols may include communication between a host and a router,
but only if the router appears as just another host. In otherwords, the
protocol MUST NOT require the host to act differently in any way when a
router is present.

Okay, I'll change it.

Stuart, I'll respond to the other comments individually. (The scenarios 
section still needs a lot of work.) I'll either change the document, 
ask you directly, or take the issue to the list. 

Erik, have your heard back from the DNS/Mcast folks about ideas for
scenarios?

I removed the definition of peer and will modify later sections so it does
not have to be defined.

I find myself wanting to repeat the same response I gave last time. Maybe

Stuart,

Here is the intro to 2.3 Zeroconf Networks
-------
A Zeroconf network is a network that at some point in time has one or more
Zeroconf protocols. By this definition, almost all networks are Zeroconf
networks. This definition is intentionally broad to avoid mandating a
network to be Zeroconf or exclude another network from using a Zeroconf
protocol. The Internet and corporate LANs are considered non-Zeroconf
networks because, today, these networks have little use for Zeroconf
protocols. 

This section describes the existing Internet network model, the Zeroconf
topologies, and a summary of the key points. 
-------
To me this addresses the concerns you express. More thoughts???

Hello Myron,

Is the intention of the writing here that there is no stand-alone Zeroconf
host ie all Zeroconf hosts must support the office-LAN-config? For example
an internet alarm clock or toaster that will never be taken to the office
must still include DHCP client?

Is a Zeroconf host = (Zeroconf + Office-LAN-config) host?

If so maybe we shouldn't call it Zeroconf (call it Multiconf instead?) or
take out the requirement for the office protocols?

Thanks,
Richard Humpleman,
Samsung.

I would argue that YES, you have to be able to handle being DHCP client.
At least some users, EVEN HOME USERS, will have networks large enough
and complex enough to be running DHCP and want to be able to still talk
to their alarm clock and toaster.

The issue here is whether the case where DHCP or other config is in use
is necessarily an "Office." I disagree (as stated above) with that
assessment.

If you build a device which cannot handle transitioning to a configured
case, then how do you have that device function on a LAN with devices
that DO transition? The user workstations are not necessarily capable of
communicating using multiple IP addresses, one zeroconf, one assigned.
If we went to IPv6 this would be less of an issue, since there is
provision in IPv6 for multiple IP addresses on a node and site-local
addresses.

While SOME systems using IPv4 will handle multiple addresses, many will
not. I don't think it's a reasonable requirement that Zeroconf systems
be able to handle multiple IP addresses (and figure out which one to
use) to accomodate devices which don't handle the transition case.

I guess I thought the goal was to allow devices to function when no
master config server or human configuration is performed. That devices
still need to be able to function in the case where someone does
configure addresses or a config server is present is, I hope, assumed.

Just my two cents on the issue...

Hi Richard,

Daniel's response represents my understanding of the common thinking. I also
agree with these thoughts because many home networks will have DHCP servers.
I hope to advance a solution that does not require a DHCP server in a home
network, but IMHO it would be impractical to have an IP host config ZC
protocol that does not operate in the presence of a DHCP server. Also, I
think it would be equally impractical to build a product that did not
operate in the presence of a DHCP server.

It is easy to accidentally introduce a mis-configured DHCP server (perhaps 
appliances with wireless interfaces) into a DHCP network. Should all hosts 
in the ZeroConf network necesarily acquiesce to DHCP in this case? 

Debugging such situations may be beyond the resources of those needing
ZeroConf and will tie network operation to the need to understand how 
to configure the network. Some checks may be useful in the interest of
robustness.

One option is to consider adding extensions to a DHCP server in order 
to automatically reconfigure the DHCP server when an operational ZeroConf 
network is detected (I am not presuming to know how to do this.) This will 
be a step towards eventual full site auto-configuration.

ZC can probably operate still, though not inter-operate with DHCP, but does
that matter?

DHCP doesn't require that every device on the network use DHCP for IP
address choice. According to the DHCP spec ARP should be used by a DHCP
Client to verify a given IP address. So devices using a DHCP derived
address should have a unique address even in the presence of devices whose
address is arrived at by other means eg ZC-only.

If there is no actual won't-work-unless requirement that ZeroConf be linked
up to DHCP-Config then I question whether there are sufficient grounds for
making the link in the ZC spec.

Thanks,
Richard.

Hi,

I also concur.  And strongly urge that we not plan to make
ZC-capable devices support multiple IP addresses (e.g.,
link-local and also DHCP-derived) on the same interface.

Cheers,

FWIW, I agree completely:

   it's important that ZC-capable devices can operate in a 
   "normal" IP environment.

   and adding multiple IP address support to ZC-cabable 
   devices overly complicates several issues.

Take care,
Pax.

Aren't multiple IP addresses a "normal" IPv6 environment?

I'm sorry, but focusing on IPv6 for ZC networking seriously pidgeonholes
the constructive work which could be done in this WG. Serious consideration
should be given to getting this ZC stuff to work with currently deployed
IPv4 networks, as well as DHCP, whereas both will probably be around for
a long time.

The charter says we discuss and address both IPv4 and IPv6.

Discussing is one thing, crafting ZC to be more "IPv6 friendly"
is another. You're missing my point, I think.

The chater simply says, "This working group will address both
IPv4 and IPv6."

I don't understand why the charter cannot be modified such that
IPv4 and IPv6 can both be discussed, but are not tied together
in such a way so that we get bogged down in IPv6 cruft. In fact,
there should be no reason why we cannot do both, but address
both v4 and v6 as separate issues? They are indeed different.

Other working groups have (and rightly so in my opinion) focused
on IPv4 functionality first, and IPv6 functionality "later".

Or is this a "one size fits all" approach? I think this needs to
be clarified so that we can move ahead.

There is very little discussion in the requirements which is IPv6
specific at this point.  This is largely because we haven't worked
hard on IPv6 issues.

I don't think we've been bogged down yet.  There are surely issues to
consider there (multicast scoping, router discovery, neighbor discovery,
etc. are all different and may have implications).  

Are you suggesting that we partition the requirements (and subsequent
'profile') work into two tracks?  This would mean minor document 
reorganizationand also a call for more document editing work. If we 
completed "IPv4 requirements" and "IPv4 profile" docs, not being done 
with the IPv6 work would prevent us from publishing.

The question is who wants to work on the IPv6 side at this time?  If
you are one of them, please give the current document a full review and 
send comments on what needs to be done from an IPv6 perspective.

Ira, Garry,

I understand that current hosts do not support >1 address per
interface.  But they don't support ZC features either.  

I believe it may be worth while supporting both a ZC (local)
address and a configured (global) address to ease transition
in and out of ZC mode.  If you have a ZC network which is fully
numbered and works fine (say your house), you don't want to have
to renumber and see stuff stop working (even temporarily) when
your dial-up networking comes up, your cable modem gets plugged
in again, etc.

The argument actually applies to all ZC protocols (host conf,
addressing, service discovery, mc addr conf).  As long as these
configurations are only used locally, they may not conflict with
the global configuration.  This is more complicated, agreed.  But
let's consider it.

Well, not necessarily, although I'm unsure on how to lessen the
interdependences between v4 and v6 in the WG.

Actually, I'm more concerned about IPv4 functionality.

Point well taken.  The idea of in-home services stopping for a
(hopefully short) period of time is a major detractor.

My viewpoint comes from implementing multiple IP addresses
in a very small environment.  But from a perceived reliability
standpoint it would be well worth the extra 'cost'.

So, I'll adjust my previous statement to indicate that we believe
that DHCP is still needed in a ZC environment, but multiple IP
aliases would be ok as long as there is no overlap.

Thanks,
Pax.

Methinks it is the IPv4 cruft that constitutes most of the bog here.

Hi Erik,

I think it's fine to consider that *some* ZC-capable devices
will be able to support multiple IPv4 addresses (let's keep
the IPv6 discussion separate - the IAB and IESG are still
far from concensus on methods/protocols for IPv4/IPv6
coexistence, in my reading of the I-Ds).

But implementors at both of my current clients (Sharp and
Xerox) are very concerned about making low-priced network
printers *have* to support multiple IPv4 addresses on the
same physical interface, because the protocol stacks they
have bought from third-parties uniformly do NOT support
that capability (and deployed printer client software
doesn't recognize the possibility).

Separate profiles for ZC protocols for IPv4 and IPv6 are
a good idea, in my opinion.  And while the IPv6 profiles
may need to be completed before the ZC WG has finished
its task, the IPv4 profiles can and should be finished
first, in my opinion.

Cheers,

Ira, Garry,

I understand that current hosts do not support >1 address per
interface.  But they don't support ZC features either.  

I believe it may be worth while supporting both a ZC (local)
address and a configured (global) address to ease transition
in and out of ZC mode.  If you have a ZC network which is fully
numbered and works fine (say your house), you don't want to have
to renumber and see stuff stop working (even temporarily) when
your dial-up networking comes up, your cable modem gets plugged
in again, etc.

The argument actually applies to all ZC protocols (host conf,
addressing, service discovery, mc addr conf).  As long as these
configurations are only used locally, they may not conflict with
the global configuration.  This is more complicated, agreed.  But
let's consider it.

Erik
