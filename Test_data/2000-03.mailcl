Hi Matt,

we have much more than just NAT solutions, I'm not a fan of NATs at all and
that's why I want to see IPv6 deployed. we have application level solutions,
Transport level solutions, and Network level translators. We also have
solutions for communicating over IPv4 as I'm sure some of you know. For more
details check the NGTRANS WG page.
For most users if applications can communicate then that's fine. I'm not
sure that the average computer user knows or even cares what IP stack
they're running. 

I think the solutions ARE there, all we have to do is just take them
seriously, instead of avoiding them.

Cheers,
Hesham

Again you're assuming that your ISP is only offering IPv4, Why ? I know that
is the situation now but may not be in the near future. In fact there are
already ISP's in Japan offering IPv6. Things like 6 over 4 or 6to4 are
expected to be in border routers. 
You don't need them in every device if you're running an IPv6 network.

	Of course, but my point is our reqts document should be addressing
the problem for "IP networks", that means BOTH V4 and V6. At the moment V6
is avoided for some reason, despite the fact that is very well suited to
this market.

How about the scenario of a ZC  IPv6 network that has one GW with the
following functions :
- configured or 6 to 4 tunnelling to communicate to V6 islands over V4
- Application level GW to communicate with apps running on V4 hosts 
- Optional Network layer translator like SIIT 
and NO NAT 
This way we have applications talking regardless of the stack they sit on.
What do you think about that ?

Cheers,
Hesham

I'm including a list of what, IMO, are the open issues for the ZeroConf WG.
Please send comments - and help to do the work to resolve the issues. 

  Host configuration - REVIEW OF REQTS DOC NEEDED.
    - Is there a requirement that topology changes are detected?
      There was discussion of this on the list.
    - How do router advert detections fit in?  How should hosts behave
      differently?

  Malloc - INPUT FOR REQTS DOC NEEDED.
    - What are the specific requirements?  (can we extract them from
      draft-thaler-zeroconf-multicast-00.txt?)  

  multicast name to address resolution - INPUT FOR REQTS DOC NEEDED.
    - What are the specific requirements for name to address resolution?
      Is this a no-brainer - Shouldn't hosts support a stub server which
      replies to multicast dns requests for their name?  What are the other
      requirements?

  Service Discovery - REVIEW OF REQTS DOC NEEDED.
    - has the list of requirements been over constrained (to sound like
      SLP)?  Are there other requirements or fewer ones?  
     
  Security - REVIEW OF REQTS DOC NEEDED.
    - Is 0 admin, 0 security OK or is this "punting?"
    - Transitioning to 'configured/administered networks' what security
      support should be described in the requirements doc?  Currently
      Reqts, Sec. 4.2 lists DNSsec, DHCP auth, MADCAP security and service 
      discovery (SLP?) security as "MUST support these protocols if 
      configured to do so."  This is a heavy requirement.  What is more
      appropriate?  SHOULD?  MAY?  Silence?
    - Is it possible to have one configuration element to configure all ZC
      protocols.  One idea is something similar to dhcp authentication where
      each server/client has a unique key pair which can be derived by the use
      of one master key and a unique id per client. (see appendix A of 
      draft-ietf-dhc-authentication-12.txt). 

  IPv6 - INPUT FOR REQTS DOC NEEDED.
    - which ZC requirements are different for IPv6?  The draft is pretty
      silent to IPv6 issues and some of the requirements may be IPv4-
      specific.  
    - Suggestion:  One requirements doc followed by two profile documents.

Erik

Meeting Goals
=============

 [1] Discuss revisions in the ZeroConf requirements draft and 
     work through remaining issues.  The goal is to move
     to WG last call after one more set of revisions.

 [2] Different protocol areas in the ZeroConf specification will
     be discussed.  This is an opportunity for the WG to
     take issue with the current spec and make counterproposals.

 [3] The ZeroConf WG will produce a 'profile' document after the 
     reqts document is complete.  The goal is to briefly acquaint 
     the WG with the state of development of each of the protocols
     which might be put into the profile specification.

I would like to comment on one of the open issues Erik Guttman recently
posted:

- Is 0 admin, 0 security OK or is this "punting?"

IMHO, leaving security out of zeroconf networking would be similar to
building a car with no locks. It's an invitation for mischief and a
dangerous thing.

Perhaps you'll say "But zero config is only for home systems and small
business. What harm will it do to leave out security?"

Pranksters will flip on people's alarm clocks at 2:00 AM. Peeping toms
will flip on lights at inappropriate times. Criminals will drive down
the street, opening doors and disabling alarms. And vandals may even
burn down houses by repeatedly triggering the self-clean cycle on ovens.

OK, maybe things won't be so bad. But we have an obligation to build
secure protocols. If a user doesn't want to use security, they don't
have to. But we have to build it in as an option.

Security MUST be included in all zeroconf protocols, it MUST be
mandatory to implement (although it can be off by default), and it MUST
be easy to use. I recognize that security can never be truly zeroconf.
But we can get pretty close (I'd be glad to elaborate, if you like).

Comments?

Steve

At the November IETF meeting I tried to raise this issue
and the majority (or at least the majority of people who spoke
up) seemed to feel that the group should punt on security
for Zeroconf networks. Part of the argument was that by 
limiting the scope of the WG, it will be able to finish its
tasks quickly.

The risk is that Zeroconf networks without adequate security
might seem like a bad idea to enough people to create a real
obstacle to the acceptance and deployment of Zeroconf technology.

I think that if the Zeroconf WG feels that it is the wrong group
to work towards simple, secure networks (as oppossed to zeroconf),
then we need to consider the creation of a complementary WG that
is chartered to deal with simple, secure networks.

I'd like an explanation of how you intend to implement security
(certificates, etc.) in a zeroconf network. The problem you get into is
that this requires configuration. It's that configuration requirement
which runs counter to zeroconf.

It is NOT clear that there is a need or desire to run secure protocols
in this case.

It is my contention that anyone requiring secure protocols and the like
can implement configured (not zeroconf) networks, and implement the
security as needed in that context. I'm not convinced we need to
reinvent all of that in zeroconf.

Here's a bit of a reality check about trying to do security with zero 
configuration (and I mean "zero" literally).

Last year, I worked with a group on designing a management installation
agent that installs system management software without any initial configuration.
The idea is that a company buys a computer and the OS comes preinstalled with
this agent that goes out and installs system management software (like
Tivoli for example) when the machine first boots. I don't want to go into
the details of how this works, we came up with a credible design but 
it is unimportant for this discussion.

The important point is that we had to back off our initial attempt to do
security without configuration because we couldn't figure out how to 
get an organization that would be willing to assume the legal risk of a compromised
key. The initial design assumed that there was an organization like Verisign
that would hand out a global public key that would be embedded in every
agent. We talked about using a cert chain, but every design we could think
of would require some kind of initial configuration on the computer before
it could work. When we looked into the issue, we found that Verisign and
others have expressed a reluctance in the past to take on the legal risk
involved in managing such a system.

Finally, what we decided to do was require the company buying the computer 
and the company selling it arrange to have the buyer's public key installed
in the agent at the time the computer is configured by the seller. This
requires some configuration, but the important information can be prearranged,
like credit card numbers, so that it doesn't have to occur with every purchase.
The legal risk in this case is clearly defined and partitioned so that 
ajudication in the event of a dispute would be much easier.

Probably there are other ways this could have been done, and I've simplified
this description some, but the point I'm trying to make is that doing
real zero conf security is a hard (and perhaps unsolvable) problem not
for any technical reason but because of legal and organizational reasons.

I think we should specify that ZC hosts SHOULD be able to operate in large
configured networks (e.g. using DHCP) as well as in standalone isolated
networks. There may be some devices, like X10-style networked light
switches, which may never need to be globally accessible, but I think the
argument for putting IP on these devices is not very strong. To my mind, the
benefit of ZC is that it allows the same devices (and application-layer
protocols) to operate in both large and small networks. If we create devices
that don't work in large networks then we don't get that benefit.

I agree with this description of the problem. I strongly believe that the
appearance of a DHCP server should offer a host an additional IP address to
use, but not take away the existing link-local address that it already has.

Retrofitting current single-homed software to support multiple addresses on
an interface may be tricky sometimes, but I think that when you design a
system from the start supporting two addresses per interface, it is not
nearly so difficult. We're not saying that ZC hosts MUST support two
addresses per interface, but I think we should make it a "SHOULD", because
of the benefits that offers.

I think that if we write the protocol requirements document properly, then
there should be no difference between v4 and v6. The protocol requirements
document should specify the mimimum requirements for Internet-style
(connectionless packet-switched) datagram networking in the absence of
external configuration information. The profile document, listing specific
protocols, may be different for v4 and v6, but even in that case I hope that
the solutions for v4 and v6 will be substantially similar, at least for host
name resolution, service discovery, and multicast address allocation.

As Rajesh pointed out, many zeroconf networks will use wireless media.
Without security, such a system is outrageously vulnerable. Powerline
networking is often similarly insecure.

Instead of the gossip- or certificate-based protocols mentioned by
Rajesh and Jim, I would suggest a simple group key model. When you buy a
new toaster, you download a group key to it (perhaps by plugging it into
a power outlet on the front of your home controller). When the toaster
needs to send an IP packet (for service discovery or whatever), it
includes a keyed hash using the group key. And it ignores all received
IP packets unless they include such a keyed hash.

Added cost: a few bits of non-volatile storage to store the key.
Calculating the keyed hash is trivial on any processor that can run IP.
Added configuration: plugging the toaster into the home controller
before you put it in the kitchen. For large appliances, you can bring
the home controller to the appliance or use a card (smart card, etc.) to
transfer the key. Don't send the group key over the wireless net,
though. Then it won't be a secret any more!

People who don't care about zeroconf security can just skip the part
about plugging the toaster into the home controller. Then it will accept
all IP packets.

-Steve

P.S. If we want to be standards-based, we can put the keyed hash in an
IPsec format. Just don't mess with IKE! Or the 4-bit processor on your
toaster will *really* start smoking!

Coming at this from a Home Networks perspective, clocks, ovens, lights, and
other similar devices will be on subnetworks or clusters that are
(hopefully) connected to the zeroconfig network. They will not be on the
zeroconfig directly. This is a reality due to the costs associated with the
devices and the media they will run on. In many if not most cases, these
cluster networks will have their own security requirements. Especially since
they will often run on shared media such as powerline and wireless. And
since there are numerous protocols for the clusters, LonWorks, CEBus, Home
PnA, Home RF, Bluetooth, etc., they will not necessarily have compatible
security methodologies. We are discussing this issue at the CEA/VESA HN
subcommittee which is working on an IP 1394 backbone standard. While we have
not reached a consensus, it appears that there are only a limited number of
options:
A.	There could be a requirement for a single approach to security that
will be forced on all devices
B.	Anything wishing to control a device on a different cluster could be
forced to know that cluster's security approach, keys, etc. 
C.	Security within a cluster network could be stripped off by the
gateway/bridge/router connecting the cluster to other dissimilar clusters
and the rest of the world

There are problems with each. 
1.	If a single security approach is mandated, then all cluster
protocols must conform and use a common key (similar to one key to all of
your doors). Not likely to happen, especially for legacy devices. 
2.	If a single security approach is not mandated but the security stays
with the messages, then anyone wishing to control a device from outside the
cluster would have to know that cluster's security system. This seems
unacceptable since there would be multiple keys and approaches required for
every home requiring a great deal of configuration.
3.	If there is no single approach, and security is stripped at the
connection to the cluster, then there needs to be some security added to the
connections to the home that would then be stripped as it connects to the
clusters. Even if there is no connection to the rest of the world, there
will be connections on the outside of the house (a deck, at the pool, etc.).
These need to be secure.

I don't have the answer, I am just pointing out the reality. The industry
needs an answer to this sooner rather than later.

At the November IETF meeting I tried to raise this issue
and the majority (or at least the majority of people who spoke
up) seemed to feel that the group should punt on security
for Zeroconf networks. Part of the argument was that by 
limiting the scope of the WG, it will be able to finish its
tasks quickly.

The risk is that Zeroconf networks without adequate security
might seem like a bad idea to enough people to create a real
obstacle to the acceptance and deployment of Zeroconf technology.

I think that if the Zeroconf WG feels that it is the wrong group
to work towards simple, secure networks (as oppossed to zeroconf),
then we need to consider the creation of a complementary WG that
is chartered to deal with simple, secure networks.

I think transitioning to larger networks is a MUST for the protocol
requirement. Whether a product vendor implements a particular portion of the
protocol or not is up to the vendor.

Hi Stuart,

As the author of that quoted text below, let me put it
back into context, please.

Manufacturers of network printers (favorite examples of
zero configuration and service location scenarios) almost
all buy their protocol stacks from third-parties.  To my
present knowledge, these third-parties uniformly do NOT
support multiple IP addresses on the same network interface
in their current implementations.

Designing a new system from scratch doesn't necessarily
mean that you get the option of altering network protocol
stacks for significant new features.

Implementors at both Xerox and Sharp have repeatedly
expressed their concerns to me in the last few weeks about
ZC-capable devices having to retain link-local IP addresses
*in addition to* administratively configured IP addresses. 

Such a requirement (even worded as a SHOULD) will tend to 
delay adoption of ZC solutions in network products. ZC is
supposed to be defining some lightweight, scalable solutions
for smaller networks, I think?

Cheers,
- Ira McDonald, consulting architect at Sharp and Xerox
  High North Inc

Retrofitting current single-homed software to support multiple addresses on
an interface may be tricky sometimes, but I think that when you design a
system from the start supporting two addresses per interface, it is not
nearly so difficult. We're not saying that ZC hosts MUST support two
addresses per interface, but I think we should make it a "SHOULD", because
of the benefits that offers.

I completely agree with this.  I would, furthermore, like to address
the issue of whether or not DHCP support is a MUST for a small
zeroconf device.  I don't see any reason why someone couldn't create a 
small "toaster" which doesn't have enough memory to fully support
DHCP, but could easily do simple zeroconf to get an IP address.  Why
should we rule out such a product by stating that a zeroconf product
MUST use DHCP if a DHCP server is available?  I think that once we
allow for a zeroconf originated address in addition to a DHCP address, 
then we should also allow for *just* a zeroconf address.  Yes, this
may mean that the device is limited to the local link, but that's a
bridge (no pun intended) which we haven't crossed yet and may end up
not being a requirement in the end.

I'd like to see the draft wording say something like:

... if a DHCP server comes online after hosts are configured with a
zeroconf IP host configuration protocol then hosts MAY acquire a DHCP
originated address in addition to their zeroconf address.

On the surface, this all seems to make sense. The issue that arises is
how OTHER stations will talk to this type of station which can't migrate
to a real address.

In an environment where all other devices are using addresses from a
DHCP server, and NEVER used zeroconf, how will this device you propose
communicate? There's no reason why a PC running Windows or Linux, which
received an address at bootup time via DHCP would ever know that a
device is also on the same LAN using another block of IP addresses.

If we assume zeroconf only happens on stations when DHCP or other
configuration isn't present, then how do we manage to communicate?
Perhaps a router must exist, configured to route between zeroconf and
whatever blocks the DHCP server (or manual configuration) are providing?
Seems messy.

Further, I'm concerned that you're arguing that DHCP client adds so much
space to an IP stack as to be a problem for fitting in small devices. I
disagree with this assessment. Small embedded systems which can
accomodate a LAN interface can also handle the small bit of memory for
an IP stack and DHCP.

This seems to making the assumption that the agreed upon method of
getting an address via zeroconf is to allocate one randomly, etc., out 
of the special link-local address space.  Maybe we have already gotten 
to the point of deciding that's the way to go in all cases, but I
didn't think we had.  If the local link has, for example, a router but 
just doesn't have a DHCP server, then it would seem the host could
discover the network number and mask from the router and then allocate 
an address from *that* address space randomly, arp for it, etc.  If
this becomes an accepted method of doing zeroconf in this situation,
then the host wouldn't really need to acquire a DHCP address since it
would already have one in that address range.

I know, there are all sorts of other arguments which could be brought
up, and have been already, why this may or may not be a good or bad
idea.  I just didn't think the issue of what address space to use had
been completely decided in all cases yet.

I think my recent messages are saying exactly this same thing, so I
guess I'm just agreeing with Stuart.
