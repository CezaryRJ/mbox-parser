I have few questions regarding the zeroconf protocol which I am unclear =
about.

Can there be two or more separate zeroconf networks, existing =
simultaneously at one point in space?
If so, how does hosts react when they come under the area of another =
zeroconf network? =20

Thanks in advance,

I am not sure I understand what you mean when you talk about a network 
existing a "point in space". The concept of network (to me, at least) 
inherently requires two or more parties, and two things can't generally exist 
in the same place at the same time. This is much more fundamental than 
zeroconf.

If you mean "if I have two seperate zeroconf networks and join them" (say by 
connecting two previously seperate LAN segments) or "if I have a zeroconf 
host and move it to another network" (say, the host is wireless), then those 
situations are specifically covered in the IETF draft.

If that is not what you mean, then you need to rephrase the question before I 
can help you. A specific example might help.

Hi all ,
	I have some comments and ideas I want to discuss with you :

1- In the draft it is mentiond that if a host sees 2 conflicting arp
packets carrying its IP then it must cease using this IP and starts
using another one , this is simply a good way for attacking a zeroconf
network .. just issue 2 conflicting arp packets within 1 sec for a
certian host and it is down ??

2- For hosts that have different link-local address for different
interfaces [sec 3.3.2 in the draft] the out going packets must be
identified by the source and destination address and port numbers ,not
just by the destination address and port number alone . This imposes
some difficulties for the implementations of zerconf protocol because it
forces the host that has multiple interfaces to work similar to a
router, because the host has to remember the interface from which
packets arrive and it has to answer this packet through the same
interface and so on ..

4- All hosts has to process each arp request or reply and compare it
with its IP address to detect conflicts and this may imposes some delays
   on the Pcs performance .

3- Why don't we use rarp instead of arp for allocating an IP address ,
and here how it goes :        
	
        a- Any host that needs an IP address sends a rarp packet
requesting and IP and this is by default broadcasted

	b- Upon recieving the rarp request packet all hosts respond by sending
a series of rarp replies the first one contains their IP 	          
address and the rest contains all the IP address that are in their cache

        c- When a host recieves all this replies it has to choose an IP
address which is not sent to it .

This approach has many advantages :

1- The number of broadcast packets is less , just 1 broadcast for the
rarp request and all the rarp replies will be unicasted [by default] .

2- No changes in the packet format of the rarp protocol.

3- Upon recieving a rarp request the zerconf protocol implmentation may
alret the users and ask them to either accept the new host in
their       network or not and here network attacks become less  .

4- The host that initiated the rarp request will have all the IPs and
physical address of the neighbouring Pcs .

5- With this kind of information and the fact that the IP is choosen
Randomly using the hardware address of the network interface card   
the    propability to choose a conflicting IP becomes less .

6- For hosts that have different interfaces on different links ,these
hosts issue rarp request on all the links that they are connected to
and    upon recieving the replies they will choose IPs that are
completely differnet form the IPs that are already in use on both links
and this  
   and this removes the address reuse ambiguity .

7- The hosts that fails or busy to respond its IP address is most likely
stored on any of the caches of other hosts and it will be sent to the
   host that requested an IP address so the propability to choose a
conflicting IP address becomes less .

8- For security issues , hosts must not respond to rarp requests that is
initiated from the same Hardware Address within a certain period        
of time [to be calculated so that no flooding happens to the network ] .

                                                                                
Best regards ,

Hi,
	I'm curious about the relationship between the Zeroconf working
group and the UPnP forum.  While I've not studied the drafts extensively it
appears that both are addressing the same problems and in the same spaces.
If this topic has been discussed below I apologize for bringing it up again;
a pointer to the previous thread would be appreciated!

Thanks,
Venky

The zeroconf working group is a working group of the ietf.
See www.ietf.org.

The UPnP forum is an industry consortium.
See www.upnp.org.

These two organizations have no official relationship.

venkatesh,

In the UPnP standard a reference exist to AutoIP and an old internet draft 
of Zeroconf link-local addressing.
The expectation is that a reference to the future link-local RFC will be 
put in the UPnP
dependent on thoughts on AutoIP and contents of draft.

greetings

peter

Hi Erik,
   Thanks for responding! The charter of the two groups appear to be similar
although UPnP appears to be looking at an expanded scope - services and
applications in addition to address configuration.

I guess I'll rephrase my question in a different way: if I were developing
say a printer, home router, or other peripheral, would I implement UPnP or
zeroconf?

Thanks,
Venky

Whether a vendor uses IETF standards or proprietary protocols is a
decision which we have no influence over.  Our goal is to produce the
best standards we can.

This is all quite true - but is also singularly unhelpful.
You might (almost) as well have said that IETF meetings supply
coffee to attendees...

Another thing that the IETF (and its working groups) do, or should do,
is produce applicability statements, to give some guidance to
implementors as to exactly when it is appropriate to implement each
of the standards that are produced, and when it is not.

That kind of thing seems to be what was being requested here, and it
is an entirely reasonable request.

It has been dumped on me to implement IPv4 link locals into IPv6/IPv4
stack.

In this stack Most of the code is shared between IPv6 and IPv4. Thus,
I would have hoped to have as little extra warts as possible in the
control paths.

In general, the IPv4 link local fits quite well, when you handle them
the same as IPv6 link local.

The control logic of IPv6 duplicate address detection (DAD) works
almost as is with this (by just tweaking the parameters: number of
DAD's, etc.). IPv6 does not include the "announcement part" (not a big
problem).

However, requiring TTL to be 255 whenever source or destination is
link local is a bit jarring. It would be nice if both IPv6 and IPv4
had same logic in this.

I wonder what would break if I just require the same with IPv6 link
locals (most of the link local use there is ND, which already requires
hoplimit=255)?

Hi...

I wonder why Zeroconf uses DNS-SD and not SLP. Especially as older MacOS X 
versions already supported SLP, and now Rendezvous adds DNS-SD. Does SLP have 
any disadvantages that prevent it from being used for Zeroconf?

bye...

mDNS is not a service discovery protocol, it is a name resolution
protocol. Nowhere in the Zeroconf documents is mDNS described as a service
discovery protocol, and the mDNS document itself
(draft-ietf-dnsext-mdns-10.txt) explicitly states that it is not about
service discovery.

So I'm curious as to how you came to this conclusion.

I think you've got it backwards. It is the m(ulticast) in mDNS that
creates a potential scalability problem. One response to that is to limit
the scope of the multicast. Hence, linklocal multicast name resolution
(LLMNR).

Other responses could also be imagined, such as the multicast supression
mechanisms found in SLPv2. However, the DNSEXT WG was concerned about the
potential issues in expanding the scope of mDNS beyond linklocal, and
unimpressed with the rationale for doing so, given the ubiquity of unicast DNS.

> protocol can be pressed into use for service discovery.

If this is true, I'd suggest that it is only because the "problem" is not
sufficiently well defined. As Erik has pointed out many times, there is
an important distinction between finding *an* instance of a service (any
instance, the "closest" instance, the "least loaded" instance, etc.) and a
*particular* instance of a service with a given set of characteristics.
The latter problem is the one to which the term "service discovery" is
typically applied, at least within the IETF.

I'd also note that just because it may be possible to discover a service
in many different ways, that does not mean that all these ways should be
implemented. On the Internet, it is not always true that having N ways to
do something is better than having a single, interoperable way to do
something.

> The most useful property of a service location protocol is that it
> be reasonably ubiquitous.

If ubiquity were the most useful property of a service location protocol
then there would be no need for an IP service location protocol at all,
since Novell IPX, Microsoft NetBEUI, and AppleTalk have had this functionality
for many years.

Rather, the most important property of a service location protocol is that
it solves the stated problem, and does so with the desired scalability.

I'm not sure who the "we" refers to in this sentence. It does not appear
that any IETF WG (or even the IETF as a whole) is guilty of this. Perhaps
you are thinking about "IPv6 configuration" rather than service discovery?
That shoe might fit better.

Tim's question doesn't mention multicast DNS, AFAICS.
DNS Service Discovery isn't really about multicast DNS, it is kind of a 
complementary peer.

Tim: I asked Stuart Cheshire almost exactly the same question, and he
pointed to http://files.dns-sd.org/draft-cheshire-dnsext-nbp.txt
(I'd point you to section 3, to save time).

Backwards might be a matter of which way you are facing.. ;)

I would like it to be able to "scale" above a single link.

In particular, I have a home gateway box that routes between networks
(private ipv4 and 6to4 ipv6), and I need something special to make
LLMNR work between links.  (I seem to recall pushback against
supporting this by bridging the requests through the router, and
pushback against mapping LLMNR names into the unicast dns namespace).

Maybe you could summarise that discussion.  I certainly don't have a
clear understanding of what the problems were said to be.

The ubiquity of unicast DNS doesn't help a whole lot if it has to be
configured.  In the case of my routed gateway a non-LL MNR is appealing.

I certainly agree about the problem definition part, although I wonder
if we have a plethora of solutions because service discovery can be
looked at in so many ways (e.g. configuring the NTP information vs
discovering an available NTP server vs anycast routing to the closest
NTP server).  Maybe I'm being unfair, but the great thing appears to
be that the problem can be defined to match the solution already
thought of.

I might be missing something, but a protocol for locating "particular"
services seems to be a superset of a protocol that locates "any"
service.  ("closest" seems to require topology info, which is harder).

I'm not following you.  It seems to me that an IP service location
protocol is required because the other ones you mentioned aren't IP
(unless you count running them on top of IP).  Or, if they all run on
top of IP, why did the IETF invent SLP?  NIH?

To me this statement doesn't say much more than "X should work".
If there are several protocols that do basically "work" do we just use
them all?

Maybe each protocol should be thought of as defining one standard
mechanism for how it should be discovered.

I was referring (rather grandiosely) to the IETF in general.
Yes, the debate about DNS service discovery springs to mind
however it isn't the only one.

Basically, home gateways often implement DHCP/DNS proxy, so that if a
router is present there is no apparent need for mDNS.

Since the home gateway is itself the DNS proxy, there is no configuration
required.

These are different problems.  For many services 'any' is OK, nearest
is GREAT.  For some services (like file servers, databases, anything
with a physical location you care about, limited access or specific
data you can't get anywhere else) - you need to find a particular 
service.

There are several issues surrounding service discovery which could be
much better handled in a single protocol.  Otherwise it is very difficult
to get uniform behavior for a user.

 1) security -      which services can advertise themselves?
                    what configuration do services, clients and
                      infrastructure need?
                    what is the policy - what does one do with
                      unauthenticated services one discovers?
 2) organization -  what administrative hierarchy is presented for browsing?
 3) performance -   what does the administrator have to improve performance?
 4) parameters -    what parameters can one obtain for services from the
                      service discovery mechanism to configure clients
                      (beyond merely the address of the server)?
                    what is the 'schema' for these parameters?
 5) naming -        what are service names?
 6) management -    what does an administrator have to do to 'set up' a
                      group of clients and servers so that all the clients
                      in the enterprise can discover all the same set of 
                      services?   How can this be controlled? 
 7) internet        what has to happen to the protocol to make it scale
    resource          to the internet - so services can be discovered in
    discovery -       other administrative domains?

This is only a partial list.  Its pretty hard to get these things right 
for even a single service discovery protocol.  I believe it would be 
impossible to do if every protocol had its own discovery mechanism.

Thanks, this is what I was looking for. Its arguments did not convince me 
though.

1. If a user-friendly name for a SLP SA is needed, you can put it into an 
attribute
2. You can append those attributes to the URL if you need to display them to 
the user (for example "service:printer:http://169.254.17.202;(name=Epson 
Stylus 900n)")
3. If you need a persistent identifier for a SA or device and the host name or 
IP is not persistent, you can put an identifier in an attribute (for example 
a large random number or a ethernet hardware address).

perhaps a more relevant question is, why is a name resolution protocol more 
appropriate for ad hoc networks than a service discovery protocol?

I don't think it is.

first because part of the definition of an ad hoc network is that you cannot 
assume a central authority for name assignment.

second, if you want devices to ship and be able to work out of the box then
you can't expect them to have DNS names that are both meaningful to humans
and relative to some DNS tree.  the most they can reasonably expect to do
is advertise their characteristics, and SLP seems like a better fit for that.

third, a lot of the problem with the linklocal proposal is the idea that 
these things should ever appear in DNS - where they can confuse applications
that aren't prepared to deal with limited-scope addresses that can fail to
work at any time.

Agreed. In fact, you can safely assume that there is not such an authority.

Confusion. I think of DNS as a tool that turns (as if by magic) some kind of
name into some kind of address (that Just Works[tm]), and can turn it back
again as well. Tree is an implementation detail for scalability.

All I want out of a zeroconf naming system is to be able to put a name
in to my GUI, and be able to access the thing with that name. If I have two
identical printers, I'd be happy to be able to change the name on one of them,
especially if someone told me to do so. I don't want printer X to require that
laptop Y is turned on and running though, if I'm trying to print from workstation
Z.

What I want out of a zeroconf service discovery system is to be able to put
in some combination of attributes (possibly none), and be offered a choice of
services on my network. I don't care much about the names or IP addresses,
just what that service can do. For example, I care that it is an colour printer,
and doesn't have much queued work, and is in the west end of the building,
not that it has the name "bolo-meister".

Some applications can't handle IPv6. That is a bug too.

What worries me is that we don't (AFAICT) have a standard set of
attributes and naming conventions for services. For example, how do
I find a colour printer without much work on my floor. What would that
look like for SLP or DNS-SD or any other sevice discovery system?
Or "who has the network storage with the engineering groups files?"
Or "who has a link to the internet that will cost less than 1c/megabyte?"
Note: I'm not looking for _a_ way to do this, I'm looking for _the_ way
to do this, that will work in general.

DNS is not just a name resolution protocol. DNS is a distributed 
database. One of the functions it serves is name to address resolution. 
DNS already has a record type for services, it just hasn't been used 
much yet.

This is why multicast DNS is used instead of unicast DNS.

The problem with SLP, in my opinion, is that it is overly complicated. 
The complication arises from the goal of advertising all of the 
characteristics of services and supporting very specific queries.

While a DNS host name is limited in the characters that may be used, 
the DNS packet format has no such restrictions. In addition, there is 
no reason that a host name should have anything to do with the service 
that host is advertising. This seems to be something SLP has overlooked.

What do issues with linklocal address assignment have to do with using 
multicast DNS to discover local services?

okay, then you're not talking about DNS names anymore, because apps can't
depend on those names to have the properties that DNS names have such as
global uniqueness.  so you don't want to use the same API to look them
up that you use to make DNS queries, because that will confuse apps that
expect the names and answers returned from that interface to act like DNS. 
and there's no particular reason to use the DNS protocol, because most of
the RR types in DNS implicitly assume some kind of distributed  management
that is not present in an ad hoc system.

I think you do care about the names and IP addresses because once you've 
identified a service that you want to use then you want to know how to
talk to it.  If you let the user choose which device/service to use then
you want to present the name to the user in a menu.  Just because you 
didn't start your query with a name doesn't mean you don't care about the name.   

Of course if you have a service discovery system (and it seens like you
need one) then you don't need the pseudo-DNS anymore, because you can 
look up the device/service names just as easily using the service
discovery system.

I don't see what one has to do with the other.  IPv6 doesn't interfere
with apps that don't know about IPv6 - they never see the IPv6 addresses
because they don't ever do AAAA queries.  whereas IPv4 linklocal addresses
do have the potential to interfere with IPv4 apps if those addresses
show up in contexts (like DNS results) where better-behaved IPv4 addresses 
usually appear.   of course with NATs etc IPv4 is pretty much of a
mess anyway, but LLs make it worse, partially because apps end up having
to treat LL addresses differently than other addresses.

well we won't solve that problem for an unmanaged network until we
figure out a way for devices to discover their location without help
(not that hard by itself) relative to their physical surroundings
(much harder) so that the searcher can figure out the concept of 
"on my floor" (presumably in the same building) by itself.

> Or "who has the network storage with the engineering groups files?"

same thing - "engineering group" inherently requires management

> Or "who has a link to the internet that will cost less than 1c/megabyte?"

same thing - cost requires management, not to mention the management
needed to authenticate for billing purposes.

so none of the above are problems for zeroconf to tackle.  that said,
having a standard, local, service discovery facility *would* be useful, 
while trying to replicate DNS doesn't seem very useful at all for this
environment.

I don't think there will ever be "the" way of doing service discovery -
there's a fair amount of evidence that you need a variety of service 
discovery methods depending on the nature of your search.

If application difficulties were as great as you make them seen, then why
is it so easy for applications to work both with an /etc/hosts file and
with DNS?

Given that operating systems have supported multiple name resolution
mechanisms for decades now based on the same APIs with no ill effects,
this concern hardly seems justified.

Nope. RR types in DNS make no such assumptions; it is resolvers that make
the assumptions, and resolvers can change to provide seamless support to
applications, as they have done for decades.

Not true. How does service discovery enable the resolution of "ping foo"?

yes, but DNS still only accepts names as queries - even with the SRV
record there is no way to say "tell me about all of the printers within 
this area".  and there never will be.

so what?  the management of the namespace is completely orthogonal 
to the way the queries are transmitted over the network.  using
multicast won't solve the problem that the DNS namespace is
completely incompatible with an ad hoc network.

okay, fine - I'll restate then.  SLP is a far better starting point
than DNS for the kinds of lookups you need to do in an ad hoc network.  

I certainly won't claim that SLP couldn't use improvement.

> While a DNS host name is limited in the characters that may be used, 
> the DNS packet format has no such restrictions. 

character set is also irrelevant to this question.  DNS simply doesn't
have any way to say "find the nearest video projectors" and that's really
what you need.  I won't claim that you can't take the DNS protocol
and try to make it look like a service discovery protocol - after all,
you can fit almost anything into a request-response protocol if you 
try hard enough - but the DNS design is already strained enough just
trying to do name lookup, and what you need for this problem isn't
name lookup.  it's really insane to try to make DNS solve this problem,
and trying to won't be good for either this problem or DNS or the
apps that try to use it.

SLP definitely needs fixing.  but it's a better starting point.

the point is that LL addresses are much  less likely to cause harm if 
they don't show up in the same contexts that ordinary addresses do.
if they show up in DNS responses, they'll break things.  if the app
thinks its doing a DNS query but the OS tries to be clever an does
an mDNS query that returns LL addresses, it will break apps that
expect an address to be reasonably stable and unambiguous.  (and 
yes, there are other kinds of ill-behaved addresses besides v4 LL;
this is a general problem that needs to be addresed, but part of the
solution is in limiting how LL addresses are used and the contexts
in which they appear)

it's *not* easy to make this work on any scale.  have you ever tried it?

on our local network hosts files are forbidden to have any but a few
'emergency' addresses in them - (if they're enabled at all), and DNS lookups 
have to come first, because otherwise we end up trying to track down 
obscure problems when a host's address changes and the host files don't
change to reflect that. 

for similar reasons we had to completely disable NIS hosts maps and WINS.

from a different angle, one of the reasons that gethostbyname() is 
a lousy interface for DNS queries is that it was designed to read a host 
file (i.e. a local disk file), where (a) you expect a more-or-less
immediate response (so it's okay to block during the call) and (b) you 
simply don't have failure modes like "temporary inability to contact server" 
or "name exists but there are no A records" that applications often
need to handle differently than "no such host".  (no, it's NOT okay to
bounce mail if you get a temp failure on the DNS lookup, but there are
still lots of programs doing this.   and no, it's NOT okay for a web
browser to say "no such server" when the the query on the DNS name fails
for temporary reasons.)

"no ill effects" is one of the most ridiculous things I've ever seen stated
in IETF.  it's been a disaster for applications and for users.    obviously
you've never tried to make an application work in a wide variety of operating
environments, and you've never tried to administer a heterogeneous network 
of any size.

wow, you just said something even more ridiculous.    the semantics of
RR types are well defined in their RFCs, and (with the possible exception
of TXT) have global scope - they're the same everywhere in the DNS.
most of those definitions have been stable for a long time.  application 
programmers depend on those semantics.  for "resolvers"  to change those 
semantics on a local basis is a gross and utterly irresponsible protocol 
violation...  it's insanity.

why should a name be different than any other service attribute?

just find all nearby systems with name="foo"

but don't expect an application like "ping" to do this unless it's explicitly
coded to do so.

Maybe.
On my normal managed LAN, I can ask for the address of "gateway", and
get "gateway.cuneata.net.", where "gateway" isn't unique, but 
"gateway.cuneata.net." is unique (or had better be, I don't think I got taken by the
latest scam :).
"gateway.linklocal" isn't that much of a extension. However it 
probably doesn't belong in the same DNS space as my authenticated
name/address pairs, both to stop confusing applications and to prevent
pollution of my DNS.

BTW: is there an example of a major application that will work with NAT,
and not work with LL?

Agree. At the service discovery step, I want to choose a capability. At the
service usage step, I want to communicate.

Maybe, maybe not.

Example situation: Tim Jansen and I meet at Linux-Kongress, want to copy
over the latest tarball of zcip. We are both using link-local addresses on 
laptops linked into the main conference network. I have some files available
for rsync, and he has a client. How does get the file?
I can tell him what I call my machine ("leon"), and that the file is available, but
that won't help without some kind of name lookup (which could be DNS).

Or is there a way of phrasing a service discovery query "find me the 
file with zcip in the name"?

I'm happy to configure the printers location when I put it down. But
what do I configure it to so that (in a zeroconf network), I can get
allow people to find it using a "standard" query?

Or a simpler case (which doesn't require management) - I want
to build a zeroconf printer that is a colour bubblejet that can do 
A5, A4 or A3, but not that dodgy American Letter format. What
 are the attributes that I should program into its SLP SA or 
DNS-SD reporting, or whatever?

it's even worse than that, because "gateway.linklocal" doesn't mean the
same thing to you as it does to me, if our contexts are different.
so you can't use that name in a referral from one app to another
and expect it to work.  even ad hoc networks don't necessarily exist as 
disconnected islands. people will be running laptops or palmtops that 
participate in an ad hoc local network around a conference table in
some hotel meeting room at the same time that they're tied via a wireless
link to a VPN to the corporate wireless network, and maybe another VPN to a 
home network.  what does "printer.linklocal" mean then - is it the
printer in the room, or the printer at the office, or the printer at home?
and can I reasonably say "just print to printer.linklocal" to someone across 
the table?  (especially given the assumption that some appliances 
are going to use linklocal as their sole means of addressing...)

and even within the same context there can be multiple hosts that
claim the same name.  in DNS there is only one authority and RRset
for any given name, so DNS query interfaces don't have the possibility
of saying "there are multiple hosts claiming this name, choose 
one of the following..."  


> BTW: is there an example of a major application that will work with NAT,
> and not work with LL?


YES!!!!!!!

First of all, what do you mean by "major application"?  Do you think 
that email and web are the only apps that matter?  "major" apps are the apps 
that *you* need to get work done, or to communicate with others in the way
that works for *you*.  those differ from one kind of user, and from one 
kind of enterprise customer, to another.   there is no typical internet
user anymore.

would you consider SIP a major app?    it doesn't work over NAT, and the
midcom group is making a royal mess trying to figure out how to make it work.

how about multiplayer real-time games?   you don't see them much in the
business world, but there's a fairly big market out there...  some of them
sort-of work with NAT but not in a general fashion - e.g. you have to tunnel
messages through central proxies.  

for the people I work with, cluster computing systems  are essential,
and they don't work over NAT. you might not think of them as "major" but
they are used to implement essential services like large-scale modeling.
essentially all high-performance computing today is cluster computing.

it seems easier to make the service discovery query "find me the nearby
machine that asserts a name of leon".  then if he gets multiple answers
back (some machine names are fairly common), he needs to disambiguate that 
somehow...

the point is that you're as likely to need to do a query for some other
attribute as you are for a name.    and even if you're looking for 
something that matches a name, in an ad hoc network you're going to need
to deal with the possibility of name conflicts that don't exist in DNS.

well, it sort of seems to me that if you configure the printer at all 
then you're not talking "zeroconf" anymore -  you're talking about
having to have an interface for that printer to allow it to be configured
(impractical for many kinds of appliance) and if you "configure" that 
printer when you "put it down" you can about as easily arrange for
DHCP to give it a stable IP address and a stable DNS name. 

and it also seems to me that "zeroconf" networks are most likely to be
used in ad hoc situations - if the network is going to be up long enough
for the names and locations of devices to be stable then (again) it's worth 
it to start managing that network to some degree.

though I'll accept that a network can be expected to have a mixture of
ad hoc and configured devices.  the printer may be stationary while the
laptops move around, etc.  so in some cases it might be reasonable to 
configure a particular printer to know some of its attributes even if you 
can't expect to configure every device that might appear on the local 
network(s) to which that printer is attached.  that doesn't mean that
name lookup is a good solution in general to the problem of finding
services  on a network.

of course the ability to discover local resources by means other
than name lookups is useful for both zeroconf and managed networks,
and it would be nice if the same mechanism could  work for both cases.

but in the case of a network where everything is managed, things are
in stable locations, etc. name lookup is "good enough" for many
purposes - whereas in ad hoc networks where services and their locations
are probably *not* stable then you need a more versatile service.

ask the IPP people - they've been thinking about this stuff for 
awhile, though I don't think it's been heavily targeted at SLP.

Clearly, to the 169.254/16 link. I don't know how to handle the case
where someone might be on two 169.254/16 links though.

If you can't, then we've lost. This has to be the outcome of zeroconf.

Again, either this works, or it doesn't. If you can't handle two hosts
claiming to have the same name, then there is no name lookup in
a zeroconf network. If the current API is broken, then we need to
fix it.

Concur. Major application is "something I've heard of", for the purposes
of this discussion. Probably I should have used "protocol" rather than
application, because any application can have bugs, and like my
previous assertion that just as applications have to be updated to 
handle IPv6 (and before that, NAT and CIDR maybe), then it is reasonable
to expect people to update applications to handle service discovery,
169.254/16 addresses and "DNS can return non-unique names" 
PROVIDED that those are valid IETF requirements.

SIP == "Session Initiation Protocol"? Never heard of it....
That wasn't the question. I asked for an app that  _worked_ with NAT.

This is the sort of application that will reasonably work with Link Local, and
not with NAT. That's the reverse question to what I asked.

Again, this will work with 169.254/16. It also isn't a representative zeroconf
market.

That would be a naming service. Whether that is different to the service
discovery service is implementation detail. (ie I don't care if it is DNS
a'la Bind, it only has do name to address to name lookups).

Not so. The whole point of zeroconf isn't that you don't have to 
ever administer things. It is that you can run networks without the
central registry and without reliance on an unrelated box being 
on-line. So I can type in "lounge room" or "basement" into my printer, 
and not have to worry that my DHCP server and DNS server
are available. 
The other thing is that if you assume that everyone has a 
DNS server and can set up a DHCP server, then you
don't need zeroconf. But the world isn't like that. My parents
have no idea about networking - but my Mum could probably
plug colour coded cables into sockets. At that point, she should
be able to print a notice for the gardening group. USB can
do that - the question is whether IP will ever be able to.

If it requires management, then you excluded 99% of people.

Home networks for non-networking gurus are very difficult. It isn't
just a matter of temporary - it is a matter of reasonable effort for 
reasonable outcomes. Home networks may not be protected by IPSEC,
not have central registries, may not have DNS servers. But that is
appropriate for some applications. Management should never require
anything more than giving the device a name and plugging it
into a hub.

Agree with the point that name lookup isn't everything, but it is
still necessary.
Name is about the only thing that is stable on my laptop. I use
different operating systems, networking devices, etc. Tim still needs
to find my laptop if he wants the _latest_ version of that file.

Absolutely. DNS-SD without a specified application API is dead.

OK - an even easier question. "I'm at a conference, and I want to
print that email from Keith. How do I find a printer on my local link?"

Yes, and that's a critical distinction between name resolution and service
discovery.

There is, for example, no concept of delegation in mDNS. And it is also
true that mDNS is not appropriate for resolution of FQDNs in most cases.
However, few hosts spend all their time connected to adhoc networks, and
names persist while network connections change. Therefore, there is little
intrinsic reason why a host connected to an adhoc network could not have
earlier obtained, and subsequently respond to queries for, an FQDN.

Rather, I would argue that the difficulty of utilizing mDNS to
resolve FQDNs arises largely from the difficulty of implementing
appropriate security mechanisms in the purely adhoc case, rather than
from an intrinsic namespace incompatibility. Were
it possible to use DNS security within adhoc name resolution, the
difficulties in use of the DNS namespace with mDNS would be largely
resolved.

I think you're overly constraining the kind of interactions that occur in
adhoc networks. Aside from finding a printer or file server, there can
also be a need for directed file transfers or web usage.

How does SLP help with displaying "http://foo/myfolder/"?

I'd claim that the question of the "best" service is a completely
different question than either name resolution or classic service
discovery.

I'm curious as to what exactly needs to be "fixed". SLPv2 has evolved over
a long period in response to deployment experience and critical
evaluations. So I'm curious as to what you believe is still missing.

> apps expect an address to be reasonably stable and unambiguous.

This seems to argue for applications caching the result of name
resolutions. That's a dangerous game, with or without mDNS, if only for
the sake of resilience. In reality, Internet hosts go down on a regular
basis, and well written applications need to deal with that gracefully.

As for the necessity of "unambiguous" naming, I'd remind you that NetBIOS
names exist within a flat hierarchy and have been in widespread use for
decades without causing the application problems you mention.

I'm sorry that your admins lack the skill to properly maintain NIS or
WINS. But saying that these systems are unworkable strains credibility --
thousands of sites run them successfully.

Yes, it's hard for applications to use name resolution correctly. So what?
Well written applications need not exhibit any of these problems.

One might say the same thing about sockets, yet I don't see you arguing

Hmmm... I guess running a network with more than two million users,
several thousand routers and some of the Internet's most heavily

Yet that is exactly what RFC 1536 did, for example, and the world didn't
end.

Keith, Joshua,

Regarding SLP:  Since the SVRLOC WG concluded going on two years ago,
an ad hoc group has formed to work on continuing standardization.  We
have a draft of RFC2608bis which aims at addressing known issues with
the protocol, specifically:

 - reducing the requirements on SAs

 - eliminating complex operations which were hard to implement and
   explain

 - resolving issues which have arisen with the protocol through
   operational experience

The basic goal is to remove features which do not have a solid basis
of interoperability and utility as we have found from three years of
experience as a proposed standard.  We clarify the rest.  We want to
do interoperability testing as soon as the spec is done and advance 
the protocol to draft standard.  All of the changes proposed so far
would retain backwards compatibility - which is to say, existing
SLP implementations would conform to the new spec.  New implementations
will not include some features which were previously in the protocol.

Now, if there are ways suggested to improve the protocol which would 
greatly improve SLP, we *could* consider breaking backward compatib-
ility and creating a new proposed standard 'SLPv3'.  Please consider
what we have already achieved, as I think it goes a long way to 
address shortcomings of SLP.

I invite your comments and participation.  Please see

http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-kempf-svrloc-rfc2614bis-00.txt
[and more]

RFC2608bis is 40 pages, an improvement over RFC2608 (54 pages) and
RFC2165 (69 pages).  It indicates our progress in simplification
of the protocol.

SLP doesn't require any relationship between the host name and the
advertised service.  SLP service advertisements include the following
information, standardized by the service templates registered with
IANA. See http://www.iana.org/assignments/svrloc-templates.htm

   - a 'type of service' string, registered with IANA or vendor specific

   - a 'scope' string, either default or set by a local administration
     to group services

   - a URI, which generally indicates the location of the service, but
     could be used for some other purpose

   - an unordered group of attributes, which could include the name
     of the service, the location of the service, configuration 
     parameters, attributes of the service, etc.

   - digital signatures to allow the recipient of the above information
     to verify that it came from a source which the receiver has been
     configured to trust (at least so far as to be a legitimate source
     of service advertisements).

As far as improving or fixing SLP, your input is extremely welcome and
timely!

Erik

Please see:
  http://www.iana.org/assignments/svrloc-templates/printer.2.0.en

According to this, the printer would advertise itself as

  service type =  service:printer:ipp
           URI =  service:printer:ipp://169.254.23.16:631/myqueue
         scope =  default
    attributes =  ...,(printer-media-supported=iso-a4,iso-a5,iso-a3),...

and

  service type =  service:printer:lpr://
           URI =  service:printer:lpr://somehost.example.com:515/myqueue
         scope =  default
    attributes =  ...,(printer-media-supported=iso-a4,iso-a5,iso-a3),...

Notes:
  1) In the IPP case, an address is given instead of a hostname.
     This is OK, but a hostname is preferred.  The host advertising
     the printer is in a zeroconf scenario and has no name assigned
     and only a link local address.  It can still use SLP to advertise
     itself, and be discovered.

  2) The port numbers in both the URLs listed are optional as they
     are the well known port numbers.  Including them doesn't hurt.

A client can request a printer with a SLP service request including

  service type =  service:printer:ipp
         scope =  default
         query =  (printer-media-supported=iso-a4)

It will receive a SLP service reply with:

  service URL =  service:printer:ipp://169.254.23.16:631/myqueue

The entire list of attributes associated with that printer can be
retreived with an Attribute request or in the service reply itself
if RFC 3059 Attribute List Extensions are supported.

The code to do this advertisement is only 3 lines or so of C or Java, 
while the request probably requires about 10 lines - using the SLP API 
(RFC 2614).

So for something like a file server, I'd want to do something like:

   service type =  service:ftp:ftp://
            URI =  service:ftp:ftp://169.254.23.16:21
          scope =  default
     attributes =  ...,(files=asa.jpg, pag.jpg, chip.jpg, par.jpg, 
tu.jpg, cielo.jpg, par2.jpg, tuno1.jpg, cielo2.jpg,  parque.jpg, 
tunovio2.jpg, marco.jpg, parque2.jpg, usps.jpg, ent.jpg, parque3.jpg, 
via.jpg, experiment.jpg, parque5.jpg, vista.jpg, eye.jpg, 
parque6.jpg, xico.jpg, etc. etc. etc. etc....)

Hey, who needs 'ls'?

Or an even better example, for something like a music exchange 
program or network jukebox software, I would just list the thousands 
of songs in the device's playlist right in the attributes section!

Hmmm...................

What ever happened to the layered approach of solving a problem?

- STEP ONE, SERVICE DISCOVERY PROTOCOL -

- Hi! I want to print. I'm looking for a printer.
- Yo, over here, I'm a printer. I speak <this> protocol.

- END OF STEP ONE -

- STEP TWO, PRINTING PROTOCOL -

- Hi printer! (Handshake.) Can you print in color on size A3?
- Sure, bring it on.

(Prints...)

- END OF STEP TWO -

Isn't this far better than:

- Hi! I want to print. I'm looking for a printer!
- Yo, over here, I'm a printer. I can do sizes iso-a0, iso-a1, 
iso-a2, iso-a3, iso-a4, iso-a5, iso-a6, iso-a7, iso-a8, iso-a9, 
iso-a10, iso-b0, iso-b1, iso-b2, iso-b3, iso-b4, iso-b5, iso-b6, 
iso-b7, iso-b8, iso-b9, iso-b10... oh and I can also print in black 
and white, grayscale, or color... I can use FinePrint or PhotoGrade 
printing, I can print 1, 2, 4, 6, 9, or 16 pages per sheet, I can 
feed paper from cassette 1, cassette 2, manual feed or envelope 
feeder... but that one's out of envelopes right now... I can also 
print collated or not... I can print with low, medium, or high 
quality... you get the idea.

Of course, printing is probably not the best example, since current 
printing protocols are not always sufficient for all that we want 
them to do, but that should be a problem for them (currently being 
addressed by the IPP guys) like Keith mentioned, not the -service 
discovery- protocol.

Even if the requirements on SAs are reduced, it doesn't change the 
fundamental paradigm flaw (for our purposes at least) of looking for 
a service's attributes, characteristics, and capabilities, instead of 
just a simple service instance, which makes everything a lot simpler 
and cleaner. This is where DNS-SD shines.

I think SLP mixes apples and oranges, tries to take over work that 
should belong somewhere else, and reinvents the wheel in some cases. 
I want to look for a file server. After I find one (or several) I'll 
bother with asking it what files it is offering. There are anough 
ways for me to do that already. This same basic concept should apply 
to any service, be it a printer, jukebox server, TiVo, coffee 
machine, etc.

I'll quote Josh Graessley's email:

"The problem with SLP, in my opinion, is that it is overly 
complicated. The complication arises from the goal of advertising all 
of the characteristics of services and supporting very specific 
queries."

And draft-cheshire-dnsext-nbp:

"This could be useful on extremely large networks with very many 
printers, but may be overkill for a small home network with only one 
or two printers."

And even in the extreme case where some narrowing of a list of 
services was strictly required, DNS-SD still provides enough basic 
flexibility to do so without getting too complex:

"6. Selective Queries

    This proposal does not attempt to define an arbitrary query language
    for service discovery, nor do we believe one is necessary.

    However, there are some circumstances where narrowing the list of
    results may be useful. A printing client that wishes to discover only
    printers that accept Postscript over lpr over TCP should issue a PTR
    query for the name "_postscript._lpr._tcp.example.com." Only printers
    that support Postscript should register this PTR record pointing to
    their name.

    Note that the printer's Service Instance Name which this PTR record
    points to is unchanged -- it is still something of the form
    "ThePrinter._lpr._tcp.example.com." The domain in which printer SRV
    records are registered defines the namespace within which printer
    names are unique. Additional subtypes (e.g. "_postscript") of the
    basic service type (e.g. "_lpr._tcp") serve to narrow the list of
    results, not to create more namespace."

Again, I don't have anything against SLP, but I don't think it's 
really the way to go for ad-hoc or home networks, which are the main 
focus of Zeroconf.

Another mistake that I think people are making is mixing up the goals 
and functionality of two different things, Multicast DNS and DNS 
Service Discovery. I've heard phrases like "look up services by name" 
and "name lookups as a solution to finding services on a network" be 
used constantly here. This is fundamentally wrong, and brings a lot 
of confusion. You are not going to look up services by name, or use 
names to find a type of service. You are going to look up a service 
by TYPE (using SRV records with types and, if necessary, subtypes) 
and THIS will return the service's NAME, which you can conveniently 
use to communicate with the device, without worrying about its 
address or if it changes. Even though the DNS protocol is used on 
both cases (in DNS-SD it's mostly out of convenience), these two are 
not the same thing, and DNS-SD is far less limited than it would 
appear by just thinking it uses a 'name to find a service.'

What does this look like in Rendevous? What goes over the wire?

What does the application ask the support libraries?

How would it look for a fax machine?

No one has suggested exhausted listing of content using SLP.
Instead, I might list a relative or absolute path of some 
meaning to an application or installer, or some metadata 
about my files or a description - "Rod's scrapbook", for 
example.  Any of these would help you manually or a program
automatically locate the data.

It is not much more complicated is it to process a query for
a type and an attribute=value than just a type.  It is a lot
friendlier on the network and on the client software to not
have each client have to interrogate all servers to find the
one it can use.

I totally agree. That's why I specifically focused my comments 
towards ad-hoc and home network scenarios, where you are much less 
likely to get excessive answers back. And I quoted that excrept from 
draft-cheshire-dnsext-nbp:

"This [...] may be overkill for a small home network with only one
or two printers."

I agree, I was exaggerating to get my point across, which is that the 
service discovery protocol should not have to deal with all this 
endless sea of attributes and characteristics of services. That's 
what each service protocol is designed for. Mixing them in with the 
service discovery protocol seems like overkill and makes things more 
complicated, overdone, and tedious, in my opinion.

Wow, that's one rich home. :-))

Again:

"This [...] may be overkill for a small home network with only one
or two printers."

It is not more complicated to process, but I don't think that's the 
issue here. There are many technologies that have failed because 
their complexity got out of hand. Not because they were harder to 
process, but because they either were harder to manage, implement, 
understand, tried to accomplish too many things at the same time, or 
a combination of these.

Once again, I think it depends on the context. Like I previously 
stated, in the context I was talking about, which is the one Zeroconf 
focuses on, SLP looks like overkill.

There seems to be some consensus that a zeroconf network may contain
services where the choice of the instance is dependent on its
attributes.
Before we get too fixated on how many printers a person might have in
their home :)
is it possible to quantify how many distinct instances of a service need
to exist before scalability issues with having to query each one in
turn, overcome the perceived complexity of SLP? 

Another question, are we going to have such a clear cut demarcation
between devices meant to be used in fixed networks (which would use SLP)
and devices meant for the home market which would use mdns?

So, we need a service discovery protocol for the home, for the enterprise,
for the internet, for the distributed object framework, for the telephony
core network services, for the data center, for network infrastructure
discovery?  We end up without any way of coordinating all of these,
keeping them consistent and making sure the approach scales well when
it is (oops!) used a larger network than intended.

This is just the issue I am wrestling with. There is no point of demarcation
in the scalability continuum. Lets say I am designing a cheap printer, I
cannot afford the resources to build in every service discovery protocol under
the sun. On the other hand, neither can I afford to say that it won't work
properly when your network grows beyond a certain size or complexity -
customers don't like that kind of thing.

So it seems to me that either DNS-SD has to scale gracefully all the way up to
huge, or that I will have to bite the bullet and build in something tougher
like SLP anyway. And then why would I want to do DNS-SD as well?

right, but machines can have interfaces on multiple links, and some of those
interfaces might be tunnel endpoints.  (after all, what's the purpose of
a VPN except to give you presence on a remote network so you can access
those resources - and if LLs are used in the way this group seems to
think they will be, those resources might include hosts accessible only 
via a LL address.)

well, it might get easier to disambiguate if you're not restricted to 
matching a single attribute when looking for that printer.

the DNS API isn't broken (at least, not for this reason) because DNS -
by design - can't have naming conflicts.  applications quite reasonably
depend on DNS not having more than one RRset per name.  but trying to use 
the DNS API to look up names where there might be collisions *is* broken.

NO.  as a fundamental part of its design, DNS names *are* unique.

sorry - I did misread the question.  obviously NATs are a hot button for me...

broad generalization: most apps that only involve two endpoints work with NATs 
as long as the app "inside" the NAT initiates all connections and as long as 
the app or users uses DNS names (and therefore they'll get translated by the
DNS ALG on the NAT) rather than IP addresses.  (But DNS ALG creates problems 
of its own because those addresses leak into other contexts where they're not valid)

so no, I don't think that every app that works with NAT will work with v4 LL
addresses - some of the problems are the same between the two spaces (both 
private addrs and LL address are ambiguous) and some are different
(v4 addrs are subject to being shot down without notice, breaking TCP connections,
and DNS lookups of any kind are a poor mechanism for obtaining v4 LL addresses)

it's quite a stretch to assume that all of the participants of a RT game 
are on the same link in the LL case but on different sides of a NAT in the
NAT case...

it wouldn't be exclusively a naming service, because it would return other
information than just each machine's name (one machine named leon is an imac,
another is a thinkpad...)

my strong impression is that there's more than one "whole point" of zeroconf.

is your Mum going to configure a printer to know its location?

well for USB the problem is somewhat easier - because you're unlikely
to have a USB connection to a network halfway across the planet
(but you might well have a VPN tunnel to such a location, and want
to access devices on an IP network in such a location).  and chances 
are that you'll *know* what is on your local USB network.  and 
from my limited exposure to USB I don't think they're trying to 
use simple name lookup from a global name space to find devices.

that and with USB there was no expectation that USB appliances would
work with an existing set of applications that was designed to talk 
with IP hosts... whereas there does seem to be an expectation that
existing IP apps can talk to LL devices even though they violate a
number of assumptions that many apps quite reasonably make.

understood and agreed.  at the same time, if you expect LL networks
to use the same interfaces and applications as existing IP networks,
you need to make LL networks behave like IP networks, and some of
the characteristics of IP networks (like stable, unique addresses
and globally unique host names) are difficult to achieve without some
degree of management.

actually giving the device a name may be too much to ask.

I don't know how you can move a laptop around and keep the same DNS name -
in my experience the name has to change even with dynamic DNS (because 
one network that I connect to insists on updating the DNS name that
*it* has assigned to the laptop to reflect the laptop's current IP
address, and so that the address lookup will return *its* name for the
laptop rather than say, the name the laptop has at home).  So if I'm 
going to try to assign a stable name for the laptop that works no matter
where it happens to be connected, that name can't be the DNS name.

it would help to stop calling it anything with DNS in the name, and to 
stop trying to make it look like DNS.  calling it DNS is confusing 
because the service you're talking about doesn't have the same 
characteristics of DNS.  having it look like DNS isn't reasonable 
because you need this service to provide more flexibility than you 
can reasonably shoehorn into the DNS protocol.

are you asking what is reasonable, or are you asking how to do this in
the context of what zeroconf is trying to define?

as for "what is reasonable" I'd say that the user clicks on network
neighborhood or runs whatever program his OS uses for that purpose,
and maybe it pops up a list of device classes - printers, scanners,
video projectors, hosts - and you select 'printer', and then it
shows a list of printers, along with characteristics and locations,
and you select 'the color printer that is 10m away'. (or lacking
GPS coordinates, you select 'the color printer that thinks its in
room xyz of Hotel Foo')

now that's a disaster waiting to happen.  just because a host might have
once been associated with an FQDN doesn't mean it's *still* associated
with that FQDN.  and if one host does a DNS lookup and gets one result
for an FQDN while another host does an mDNS lookup and gets a different
result, you've just broken DNS.

the problem isn't just security, it's also consistency.  what you're 
essentially saying is that mDNS can be used as a cache for real DNS, 
and with appropriate constraints this might be doable.  but with real 
DNS then there really is an assumption that you can get to an authoritative 
server - one that is controlled or at least chosen by the party that assigned 
the name, and which is generally updated in a timely fashion - and get 
current, authoritative answers from that server.  with mDNS this would 
not be possible - it's as if you're disconnected from the network and
you're stuck with whatever is in the cache of your local resolver.

it doesn't. but URLs are supposed to have globally consistent meanings, 
and it's not within zeroconf's purview to change that.  

more generally, just because ad hoc networks are useful is not a 
justification for this group trying to change the behavior or meaning
of well-established interfaces and protocols in whatever manner it sees fit.

perhaps.  but my point is that trying to overload DNS for this purpose
does harm to DNS and to apps, and doesn't really solve your problem
anyway.

it's been awhile since I reviewed SLP, so I don't really remember details.
but I recall thinking that that service: URI was pretty bogus, and that
it was fairly unreasonable to expect SLP to work beyond a relatively
local portion of the network topology (nothing inherently wrong with that
but some SLP proponents were claiming more generality)

not exactly. but at the same time it's completely reasonable for
apps to pass around addresses - for many purposes DNS lookups 
don't work very well.

when the host goes down it tends to break existing connections to that
host anyway, and it tends to kill all the apps running on that host anyway,
so having the address be able to change when that happens is probably
not a big deal.  that doens't mean, however, that DNS is the mechanism
that every application should use to find the new address of that host
if and when it happens to reappear on the network.

NetBIOS doesn't try to look like DNS, and people don't try to use NetBIOS
names on an internet-wide scale.  (e.g. I don't give you the NetBIOS name
of my server and expect you to be able to connect to it)

they do have the skill. the proper way to maintain NIS host maps is to turn them 
off, because they just get in the way.  sane admins do not try to make their

you're missing the point, which is this: when you overload interfaces to
try to do things that they weren't designed to do, you break apps that
use those interface.  you're changing the API (often poorly) without
changing the apps that were designed to use the old API.

sockets is a bit klunky, but it works fairly well.  the worst problem I
have with sockets is that there are some performance implications associated
with forcing the programmer to separate (e.g.) connect() and write() and
sending an EOF, and it's hard to extend that interface to do some things 
I want to do with TCP.

but (and this is just a guess at what you might be thinking) it is NOT
a bug that sockets works with IP addresses rather than DNS names.

not necessarily.  how heterogeneous is it?  how much control do you

I disagree, to a point.  the service discovery protocol shouldn't have 
to know about the semantics of those  attributes, but it should be able to
advertise those attributes for the benefit of client programs that can
make use of them.

that's a really silly example.  surely nobody expects to use a service

the v4 LL document has some explicit assumptions about how many hosts are
reasonable for links using LL addresses - 1300 hosts is considered
an upper bound.   so a reasonable test of SLP (or any other candidate 
discovery protocol for use in ad hoc networks) might be: how well will it 
work for networks of 1300 hosts with a reasonable mix of host classes
(workstations, printers, etc.)?

That is one of the merits of having the "toy" 32-bit IPv4 Internet for
silly experiments and Proof-of-Concept market trials. Once all of the
testing is worked out, people can move to the more serious and stable
IPv8 64-bit address space, using 128-bit DNS services. People do not
have to be constrained in their thinking by the narrow-minded I* society.
There is a place to expand and grow.

Not always. If you have a large number of devices, then you may want to choose 
a capability. But in your home network, where you have an Epson and a Lexmark 
printer, you want to select "the Lexmark" or "the Epson". So here DNS-SD 
works as intended.

The most natural way would be to have an instant messenger that can discover 
persons in the local network, so you would search for my name. Fortunately 
this is quite easy with SIMPLE as IM protocol because it can work 
peer-to-peer, you just need to discover the other person's URL using a 
service discovery protocol.

You didn't, you just showed that it is not very smart to use a service 
discovery protocol when a protocol for distributed searching would be 
appropriate. For example a protocol that sends the query to all service 
agents and they respond to the user agent if they find any matches (BTW it 
would be quite interesting to add this feature to SLP).

I wasn't talking about distributed searching (if I understand you 
correctly). Just a client looking for an ftp service, and a server 
that is advertising its service and also its 'offerings.' (Files in 
this case, which is an example I exagerated on purpose.)

You're right in a way though, that was precisely my intention. To 
make a strong distinction between the processes (and protocols) for 
discovering a service instance, and for discovering said service's 
characteristics, attributes, and capabilities, in order to express my 
point of view about how service discovery should work, with focus on 
Zeroconf networks.

Thanks!

Well, I'm not sure what point you were trying to make.   It's certainly
not an argument against a service discovery protocol, nor an argument
in favor of trying to use a variant of DNS to discover hosts on an ad hoc
network.

Ok, so just to try and keep up, you've moved from service discovery to 
name resolution?

It is true that gateway.local. wouldn't mean the same thing to two 
different people on different networks in much the same way that 
10.0.1.12 would would not mean the same thing. Does that mean that 
names that only have a local scope would not be useful? Addresses 
without global scope are very useful and application don't necessarily 
have to be rewritten to make use of them. Throw something nasty like 
NAT in to the picture and things get pretty hairy, but that's a 
separate problem.

Name collisions can be detected and avoided. This is not a difficult

All of the examples you have just given do not work with NAT. Brad 
Hards asked if there were any applications that would work with NAT but 
not work with link local addresses.

I think two different problems are being confused here. Are you arguing 
about name-to-address translation or service discovery? These are two 
totally different things.

Name-to-address resolution is pretty straightforward. Given a name, 
what's the address. The example earlier of gateway.linklocal. to some 
address is name-to-address resolution, not service discovery.

Service discovery is much more involved. A common example of service 
discovery is locating all of the printers on the local link. Most 
service discovery protocols need two phases. The first phase is to 
discovery the actual services on the wire. The second phase is to 
resolve a service name in to the necessary information to make use of 
the service. Going back to the printer samples, we would want to get a 
list of all print services for the first phase. Once a print service 
has been picked, the print service would need to be resolved to the 
specific information required to actually print such as the ip address, 
port number, and perhaps print queue name. By separating the service 
name from the ip address/port number, you can cache service names and 
look them up just before communicating with a service, allowing the 
service to transparently change to a different host or use a different 
address.

Part of every service discovery solution is the ability to detect other 
services with the same name when registering to avoid collisions. This 
is not an impossible problem to solve.

Zero configuration doesn't mean zero options. Zero configuration means 
it can work out of the box without being configured. It makes sense to 
have a printer using zeroconf allow for someone to change settings such 
as the advertised printer name. zeroconf is especially important when 
you first get the printer out of the box and do not have any way to 
interact with it. With zeroconf, you could potentially hook up the 
ethernet jack, use service discovery to find the default name the 
printer has choosen, connect to it, and then set some options such as 
the name it will advertise print services under and perhaps an IP 
address if it would be useful for the printer to be globally accessible.

What do you mean by a zeroconf network? Devices supporting zeroconf can 
be plugged in to a network and interact with other devices supporting 
zeroconf without additional configuration. This doesn't mean that every 
device on the network is unconfigured. There is no reason a device 
without a globally accessible address should not be able to communicate 
with a device with a linklocal address if both devices are on the same 
local link. Devices that are not configured with a global address will 
be limited to communicating only with other devices on the local link.

No argument here, name-to-address resolution is not service discovery. 
That is not to say that DNS formatted packets cannot be used for 
service discovery.

Yes, and SLP so far has failed. Perhaps SLPv2 will have better success. 
I haven't read the draft so I'm not sure if the flaws have been 
addressed. I'll give it a read tonight.

No, name lookup is not good enough, anywhere. We need service discovery 
for managed and unmanaged networks alike.

Find out what the customers you're targeting support. Is there support 
for using SLP to find printers built in to common operating systems out 
there? What about DNS-SD? Can you cover enough of your customers by 
implementing one or the other? If both will work, which one is simpler? 
Which one will give your customers a better user experience?

locally-scoped names are problematic, because they can escape outside
the context in which they are valid.  but we've always had things
like 'localhost'.  many sites also have names for local machines
that aren't advertised to the outside world.  there's an semi-formal
(I think it's documented in some RFC) convention that any name not 
containing a '.' is a local name, and that any name containing a '.' 
is fully-qualified and therefore globally scoped.  many apps have
special-case handling for local names, but many apps also assume that
local names can be changed to FQDNs by appending some string as a suffix.

> Addresses 
> without global scope are very useful and application don't necessarily 
> have to be rewritten to make use of them. 

ambiguous addresses are also problematic, for much the same reason that
ambiguous names are problematic.   some apps don't need to be rewritten
to make use of them.  for other apps it's extremely difficult to cope
with them at all.

> Throw something nasty like

well, if you draw a Venn diagram with circles for the problems caused
by NATs, the problems caused by ambiguous addresses, the problems
caused by ambiguous names, and the problems caused by unstable addresses,
you find that each category causes its unique problems but there's
also a lot of overlap between the categories.

(and then the proponents of one of these use the existence of
the others to justify their doing further damage...)

please explain.  if an app on an ad hoc network is calling gethostbyname() 
to look for a host named "foo" and there are two such hosts, what is
returned?    neither an error indication nor the address of either host
seems reasonable.

> All of the examples you have just given do not work with NAT. Brad 
> Hards asked if there were any applications that would work with NAT but 
> not work with link local addresses.

right, I misread his question.  but the answer is yes - there are apps
that work with NAT but don't work with LL addresses.  for instance,
any app that needs to keep connections open for a long time will be
less reliable on a v4 LL network because of the potential for address 
collisions.  also the topological scope of private addresses used by 
NATs is often considerably larger than a single link, so apps using
private addresses behind a NAT will work when those apps will fail
when trying to use LLs.  this is particularly true for apps that
do address referrals - you could run a cluster computing environment
behind a NAT and it would work fine if all of the nodes were behind
the NAT, but it would fail if LL addresses were used and different nodes 
were on different physical links (as is often the case in dedicated 
clusters).  apps on a host with multiple interfaces will fail more often 
if LL addresses are used on more than one of those interfaces, but NATs 
don't impose this problem.  etc.

I'm comparing the effictiveness of the two approaches at solving the
problem where users (via their applications) are trying to find resources 
on an ad hoc network.

yes it does.  however it doesn't necessarily make sense to insist 
(on an ad hoc network) that the device ONLY be able to advertise a name,
and to impose the constraint that the name is expected to be unique.

nor does it necessarily make sense for the effectivness of users at
being able to find resources on an ad hoc network to be dependent 
on someone explicitly configuring those resources to have names
other than their defaults.

fine, but last I knew zeroconf was being touted as far more than 
a mechanism for initial setup of devices.

you can make any request-response protocol into an RPC if you try hard
enough.  but why try to overload DNS when doing so breaks assumptions
in both DNS and applications?

"so far" zeroconf has failed too.   

I would not recommend to adopt SLP wholesale.  But at least they've tried 
to solve the problem of finding resources on a local network without having 
to know their names - which seems like a lot saner approach to finding 
resources on an ad hoc network than to expect people to know the names of 
unfamiliar devices.  It's worth looking at it as a possible starting point.

I won't argue against that at all.  By "good enough" I meant that people
have so far been able to muddle through.  I just think it's far more 
difficult to muddle through with just names on an ad hoc network 
than to muddle through with names on a stable, managed network that you
use frequently.

gethostbyname_zconf() or equivalent has to return a pointer to an array
of addresses. Otherwise name lookup in a zeroconf network can't work.
Doesn't matter what the backend implementation is (DNS, service discovery 
by name assertion, whatever) - name overlap is an instrinsic property of networks
that don't have central administration.

These applications will also fail when DHCP leases expire (think wireless,
roaming, etc).
I think that the cluster argument is bogus, since computing cluster is not a viable
candidate for zeroconf.

I don't think that anyone is making this argument. However names are
important, and people can reasonably expect to use them.

I don't think anyone is making this argument either. But if I do 
choose to change the name (or some other attribute), I'd expect to be
able to distinguish it from other resources.

if you don't try to overload the existing DNS APIs then  I have far fewer
problems with any of this stuff.  though why you would want to reuse any
of DNS for this very different purpose is beyond me.

a DHCP server that fails to renew leases without a good reason is broken,
and DHCP is a really lousy mechanism for mobility.  please don't use one 
kind of brokenness to justify another.

are you saying that such apps will never see or have to deal with LL addresses,
and they'll never see or have to deal with ambiguous DNS names?  

from the last LL document it looked as if hosts were going to expose LL 
addresses to apps whether or not the apps could deal with them, and there
was strong objection to NOT exposing apps to such addresses.  unless they 
are taught to special-case LL addresses, apps will treat them as ordinary 
addresses, listening for connections on them, using them in referrals, etc., 
even though those addresses may be unsuitable for their purposes.

names are indeed useful as long as you don't try to make them do too
many different things, and as long as you don't confuse one kind of
name for another.  it would certainly be useful to have the ability
to find a host on an ad hoc network by name.  but it would be bad
if these were confused with DNS names, because they don't have the
properties of DNS names.

including other resources with the same name that you've chosen?

On a quick review of gethostbyname(), I note that it already returns a pointer
to an array (well **h_addr_list). Note also that gethostbyname() has no
DNS semantics - DNS is but an option.
Reference: Stevens, Unix Network Programming, pg 393.
If you are _really_ worried, the gethostbyname() could return h_addrtype
as somthing new, like AF_ZCONF.

Running code. All we need now is the rough concensus part :-)

It is the same kind of brokenness. Networks are now seriously dynamic
things, and assuming long term consistency between names and addresses
is a broken assumption.

What happens if the DHCP server falls over during the night and gets
replaced. Will all be the same tomorrow?

I had a researcher who insisted that zcip (http://zeroconf.sf.net) should be
able to generate random IPs. That was a firm requirement for privacy for
his application - there should be no fixed relationship between hardware
and IP. He was pulling the network interface down at random intervals
and getting another IP (based on the zeroconf linklocal approach)
to prevent long term tracking. If applications cannot cope, then it was
OK to fail (gracefully:).

If it is distinct in any way, then I should be able to distinguish it.
Of course, it would be nicer if I could make the name unique, but that
cannot be made a valid assumption in an ad-hoc network.

yes, but the expectation is that those addresses are all from the same RRset,
and that they refer to the same host or service, not differnet hosts or services
with the same name.

> Note also that gethostbyname() has no

that's garbage.   programs expect gethostbyname() to provide access to DNS.
even if DNS is sometimes front-ended by other services like host files or
NIS, the reality is that programs break if they can't lookup DNS names with 
that interface or if the gethostbyname() call has significantly different
semantics than a DNS A lookup.

most applications do not bother to check.

DNS certainly isn't running code for this application.  and just because
someone has implemented something doesn't mean it's a good idea to standardize it.

perhaps.  but neither is it safe to asume that the name is more stably
bound to whatever you want to refer to than the address.  

networks are very dysfunctional these days.  that's not a good excuse for
making them even more dysfunctional.  

what we need to be doing is figuring out ways to make the network behave 
*more* consistently from one place to another, so that we'll increase the
market for new applications by giving them more places where they can
run - NOT adding even more reasons for the network to behave less consistently.

> What happens if the DHCP server falls over during the night and gets

if your DHCP server can't survive the failure (i.e. if the new DHCP
server won't honor the old leases), then many of your apps will break.  
that's a bad design - the DHCP server is a critical component that
doesn't share fate with the endpoints.

IPv6 has privacy addresses, which are a similar idea.  but it's one thing
to make such addresses available to applications that have no need for stable  
addresses; quite another to insist that all apps should have to use these
things.  it's incredibly naive to think that apps don't need stable addresses.

"disaster" seems rather too strong a word.

Right now the DNS back end resolver at my ISP may have cached some
RR set associated with a FQDN.  Meanwhile, back at the authoritative
server, the RR set gets updated.  Oops..  now my backend resolver
has inconsistent data!

Does that mean the DNS is broken?  I don't think so -- it just means
that the DNS has a weak cache consistency model.

What if the consistency with mDNS was "no worse" than the DNS today?

Hmm.  So would you be happy with clearly identifiable locally
scoped names?  (e.g. some.thing.local.arpa for all names that
might refer to a non-global name)

Type http://foo/ on a Windows system and look at the trace of what issues
from the machine. If the DNS queries do not return a result, you will then
see a NetBIOS name query. The nature of the query will depend on whether
there is a WINS server operating.

well, it depends on how this is used.   if hosts start asserting names
for themselves on some networks via mDNS while the real DNS is returning 
different/conflicting information for that name, that's really bad.  

if random hosts start caching DNS informaiton and providing it through mDNS 
(even within the TTL of that information), and other hosts start trusting 
that information, that produces additional potential to propagate stale
DNS data, and to propagate modified DNS data (whether or not there
is any malice, there have certanly been DNS caches that subtly
modified the data that they propagated in a way that broke things)

right now the thing that keeps DNS as "honest"  as it is is that
there's a high probability of being able to contact an authoritative
DNS server for the zone you need.

right - but now you're introducing additional caches, and each cache
is a potential source of error.

I'd want to see/do a lot more analysis before coming to a conclusion.

they might be "clearly" local to you and me, but not "clearly"
local to an application.  local dns-style names seem like the sort 
of thing you want to use very sparingly if at all - they're yet another 
thing that reduces location-independence and the ability of apps to 
run in any part of the internet.

I cannot accept the RRset requirement (because of the DNS connotations),
 although I would concede that the main reason for the options with
 AF_INET is to support a single logical entity
(not two distinct, probably unrelated machines).

That is a bogus assumption. DNS did not get created at the birth of Arpanet,
and people should not code background implementation into their apps.
gethostbyname() does and should allow you to get the IP addresses
for a given name.

And that is a bug.

From a local man page (on Linux)
<quote>
       Glibc2 also has a

       struct hostent *gethostbyname2(const char *name, int af);

       that  works  like  gethostbyname(),  but  permits  to specify the address family to which the
       address must belong.

       The Austin draft marks gethostbyaddr() and gethostbyname() legacy, and introduces

       struct hostent *getipnodebyaddr (const void *restrict addr,
         socklen_t len, int type, int *restrict error_num);

       struct hostent *getipnodebyname (const char *name,
         int type, int flags, int *error_num);
</quote>

AF_ZCONF isn't a bad idea to prevent well coded legacy apps from getting
answers they didn't expect.

That is a bug too.

DNS already provides all kinds of lookups that are only locally sensible.
Certainly people shouldn't pollute the Internet DNS system with those
names, but there is little difference to mycompany.west and mycompany.east
vs mymachine.linklocal and myprinter.linklocal.

gethostbyname predates DNS - it was originally used to look up names in /etc/hosts.
but gethostbyname() got extended to do DNS lookups in the early 1980s, and 
ever since the mid-to-late 1980s apps have expected that if they feed something
that looks like a DNS name (generally meaning that it has one or more dots) to 
gethostbyname() then it will result in the address records associated with that 
name in DNS being returned.

so despite its origins gethostbyname() is now the de facto standard interface
for querying DNS A records.  there are other, better interfaces, but gethostbyname
is the most portable.

no, that's a feature.  trying to change functionality that applications have

if you are talking about gethostbyname2(), then say gethostbyname2.
though I still think it's a bit brain-dead to have multiple addresses 
returned from AF_INET and AF_INET6 queries indicate multiple addresses
for the same host or service, and to have multiple addresses returned
from AF_ZCONF (do you want different versions for v4 and v6?) mean
different hosts or services with the same name.

overloading an query interface to do something completely different 
accomplishes nothing useful and is just a good way to confuse people.

so it's a bug.  it will break lots of apps to tickle this bug, and there's
no good reason to do so.

yes, people misuse DNS.  but then they're responsible for whatever problems
they cause, and they can presumably fix whatever they break or deal with
the consequences.  

if we encourage people to use DNS in a stupid way, then the damage is much
more widespread, and it's very hard for us to undo the damage.

That is also true for the handling of "foo" by DNS resolvers -- depending
on the searchlist, this may resolve to different FQDNs. So this locality
has always existed.

not many do so explicitly.  I have heard of email MTAs that do this
under some conditions because a significant percentage of email bounces 
are due to DNS misconfiguration (like updating a zone without changing
the serial #).

but what I was getting at is that being able to access the DNS
servers directly makes it at least possible that for whatever reason, 
inconsistencies between caches and authoritative servers will be noticed -
not necessarily by programs, but by humans that notice inconsistent
behavior from one place to another.

it might.  though think DNS-SD needs considerably more justification 
than as an ad hoc cache to real DNS.

if you also have a separate API for the two namespaces, this has the 
advantage that apps that can't deal with local stuff won't see it.

that's assuming that users understand not only the subtle differences 
between a DNS name and a private name, but also which kinds of names
work with which apps.   the app isn't going to get any less confused
unless it has special-case code to deal with private names.
(for instance, don't expect the remote web cache to do useful things
with URIs containing private names...)

no I don't think we want every name  to be globally unique, but 
I think we want to be able to know when we're using a unique name.
also, we expect predictable behavior from computer programs - but
when we give them ambiguous names for things the results become 
less predictable.

The ZEROCONF WG has two charter items it needs to complete:

 1. The revised Zeroconf Requirements document
 2. The revised IPv4 Link Local Address autoconfiguration document

Both have been through last calls and require final clean up and
the approval 'process' with the IESG.  This work is proceeding
very slowly, regretfully, but we need to come to closure.

====================================================================
ACTION:  DROP ZMAAP and HOST PROFILE ITEMS FROM CHARTER?

Other efforts have dropped off entirely and should be eliminated 
from the charter:

 - Zeroconf Multicast Address Allocation Protocol
 - Zeroconf Host Profile

Please send comments on this proposal to the list.
====================================================================

Please note we are not chartered to work on multicast name 
resolution or service discovery protocol standardization
though we do discuss the requirements for them in [1] above.

Folks,

The appropriate place to discuss these matters is on the DNSEXT WG
mailing list.  I am cross posting this message to the ZEROCONF WG
list only in order to end the thread which we do not have the 
charter to resolve and redirect discussion to the forum which does.

Keith Moore and various interlocutors have been discussing
multicast name resolution on the ZEROCONF WG mailing list.
I will not summarize that discussion, but I believe the below
captures most of the major points.  If I fail to do justice
to your particular concerns, please expand.



Multicast-Based Name Resolution
-------------------------------

Multicast-based name resolution has been a goal of the ZEROCONF
WG since it was chartered.  The work item, to create a standards
track protocol, has been taken on by the DNSEXT WG.

This effort has been troubled, again because of disagreements
about the functional requirements, but also because of unease
from many involved in DNS standardization at the IETF.  The
requirements expressed in ZEROCONF WG documents were either
not clear, or they were not meet with agreement in the DNSEXT WG.

I believe the goals for multicast name resolution arise from
the following observations.

 - Peer to peer naming protocols exist today, and have for a
   long time (NetBIOS and AppleTalk).  

 - It is possible to use these protocols to resolve names without 
   the use of DNS.  

 - NetBIOS and AppleTalk names can be *the same* as host names in
   the DNS.

 - Some hosts *ALREADY* use alternative naming mechanisms to resolve
   names when DNS is not available (NIS, NetBIOS, AppleTalk, others).
   As has been brought out on the list, this is common practice and in
   no way incorrect with respect to the resolver APIs.

 - There is no IETF standard way to provide this function, over IP.
 
 - It is desirable to retire NetBIOS and AppleTalk for many reasons
   but without a functionally equivalent IETF standard solution, this 
   is not possible.

The ZEROCONF WG has attempted to articulate the requirements for
an IETF standard to allow this name to address (and reverse) 
resolution in environments without DNS support.

There are numerous areas where we run into differences of opinion.

 - What does it mean for hosts to respond to fully qualified 
   domain names which DNS would normally respond to?  Should 
   multicast name resolution use the same namespace as DNS? 

   Some have held that we need a special 'local' namespace,
   while others believe that a host should be able to respond
   to requests for its 'own' name.

 - What we really want is applications that continue to 
   function even when DNS fails or is not present:  http://foo
   will succeed if there is a host which can respond to a
   name resolution request for 'foo' using the non-DNS multicast
   name resoultion protocol.  

   Some seem to hold this is not an appropriate objective.

 - Should multicast name resolution be possible whether even when
   DNS *is* available?  This would prevent 'local' name resolution 
   from ever failing and ensure it always returns consistent
   information.

   Many have asserted that DNS has to be used, exclusively,
   for domain name resolution if it is available as this is the 
   current and expected behavior.

That these issues have not been clearly resolved has left
work on LLMNR (draft-ietf-dnsext-mdns-10.txt) in an uncertain state.  

Let's try to resolve the issues and can come up with a solution which 
will serve the many users of local, unadministered networks.

Thanks and regards,

Erik

I think my point still holds - just because http://foo/ might produce some
results for you doesn't mean it will produce the same results for me.  
the fact that windows tries to do a netbios query is arguably a bug - because
http URLs with two slashes are supposed to have a DNS name or IP address
- not a netbios name.

fortunately, many apps know that "foo" is not a legal DNS name, and that
it cannot therefore be expected to be globally unique.

While there were hopes that the ZEROCONF WG could work out the
differences between different service discovery options, it has
become clear that this will not happen.  The best we can do is
publish the section on service discovery in the latest ZEROCONF
requirements documents.

 - The ZEROCONF WG is not in the position to 'pick winners.'
   It is up to vendors to decide what protocols to implement.
   It is not within the ZEROCONF charter to do any service
   discovery protocol standardization.

 - There is disagreement among participants whether service 
   discovery is a 'naming' function, a la AppleTalk, or a 
   service-distinguishing 'search' function, as per SLP.
   This disagreement divides the WG chairs, I must add.

 - There requirements of service discovery have been a matter 
   for continual debate and redefinition, leading to little 
   practical progress.  What scale does it need to perform at?
   What functions does it need to provide?  What security?
   How does the namespace (and attribute space) get managed?

I want to set the expectations of those participating in the 
recent thread on service discovery.  There is little the
ZEROCONF WG can do, given its charter and history to resolve 
these issues.

Do many applications really make use of this?

I would expect they would just call gethostbyname() and get
whatever the local back-end resolver happened to pluck out
of its cache.

Potentially.  And so is every new DNS back-end resolver implementation.
If however it were done right, it might just work OK.

(actually, I meant "non-global *address*" rather than "name")

Perhaps -- but you appear to be moving to a different argument
just at the point where it gets interesting to me.

I see the advantage of having a private namespace is that you
can keep the global stuff and the non-global stuff separate.
No site-locals/private-addrs returned along with global addrs.
An application (such as a web browser) would happily work with
either, being less confused, because the user (maybe via a DNS
search path) explicity used a private DNS domain.

Realistically, people don't want *every* host name to be a globally
visible and unique one.  I for one think that is unscalable.
A domain name per house, per car, per bicycle, per human, .. ??

a) apps don't know anything about network topology boundaries.
   there may be some app components that can access DNS which are
   communicating with other app components that can only access mDNS.

b) even on the same host, or for hosts on the same link, DNS accessibility 
   (and presuambly mDNS accessibility) may vary over time - so 
   with just a slight delay different components can have different views
   of the meaning of a DNS name - one from DNS, another from mDNS.

   of course the same could happen if different hosts contacted different
   DNS servers for a zone, but at least the servers are under control of
   that zone.

I must have misunderstood an earlier message then, I thought it was being
proposed that mDNS could be used to return data for a DNS name for which 
the host returning the data would not be an authoritiative source of that data.

widely shipping products have been taking queries for FQDNs and producing 
results that are inconsistent with DNS lookups?  which ones?

There's a distinction between having a working DNS server, and being
configured with a DNS server. mDNS is only used if no DNS server is
configured -- not just because the DNS server is down, with the possible
exception of unqualified names (e.g. "foo"). With IPv4, the
reason to be without a DNS server is typically because there is no DHCP
server either. With IPv6, the configuration story is not clear yet.

Note that it is already possible for one host communicating with another
to not have a DNS server configured, while the other does. This means, for
example, that one side may not be able to do a reverse lookup for the
other side in the conversation.

I'd be curious to understand how mDNS changes the failure modes from not
having a DNS server at all, given the above.

As noted above, mDNS usage is not determined by DNS accessability, but by
DNS *configuration*.

That is not what the DNSEXT version of the mDNS spec says (not sure
about the Apple version). Take a look:

http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-ietf-dnsext-mdns-10.txt

(draft -11 will be online later this week).

I think it's fair to say that every shipping operating system allows
access to non-DNS naming mechanisms (/etc/hosts, NIS, NetBIOS, AppleTalk,
etc.) from resolver API calls.

Please explain how this can happen. mDNS is only used on networks where
no DNS server is available.

Again, please explain how this can happen. The mDNS and DNS caches are
required to be separate, and hosts only respond to queries for which they
are authoritative.

Again, please explain how this can happen, given that the mDNS and DNS
caches are distinct. One cannot poison the other.

If you are interested in this, you might post the question on the DNSEXT
list where discussion of DNS (and mDNS) occurs.

You speak as though the use of local names were something new. It isn't.
This functionality has been present in shipping products for 10 years now,
and has not produced the "disaster" you speak of.

or that one side may not be able to use DNS names in referrals to the 
other side.    (I agree that this is already possible)

I suppose it is similar to the situation where one host uses DNS
and another uses /etc/hosts with missing or stale information.

okay.  though it's easy to imagine a configuration option that says
"try DNS first and if that fails try mDNS"  (much as many hosts now
have one that says "try DNS first and if that fails try /etc/hosts"
( or nis, or whatever ).  for nomadic hosts it's nice to avoid having
to explicitly change configuration.

okay, I see what you're saying.  and of course they have to have some
non-DNS mechanism for the very case where the host is operating in an
isolated network and cannot use DNS.  

at the same time, if you don't configure your host so that gethostbyname() 
calls DNS (directly or through an intermediary) then a lot of applications 
just don't work - more and more apps expect direct access to DNS.

Oops.  I have not been to the past two IETF meetings and 
have been relying on the mailing list to stay informed.  

I gather it was decided at the Yokohama DNSEXT meeting to 
take the next revision of the mdns draft to WG last call.
So the doc isn't in an 'uncertain state' after all, except
maybe now after my untimely comments :-/

Erik,

thanks for the summary; to me it seems a reasonable reflection of the 
recent zeroconf discussion.  I'll go look at the namedroppers archive 
and see if I can glean what that group has said about this.

my concerns can briefly be summarized as follows:

- in general, changing existing APIs will break applications.  one way 
  to do this is to change an existing name lookup function in such
  a way that the names no longer have the same semantics as before,
  or it treats names as valid that were formally invalid, or 
  by introducing new error conditions that need to be distinguished
  from the old ones.  such changes seem a likely result of changing
  an existing name lookup API to also handle name lookup in an ad hoc 
  network.

- local names can be useful, but they should be easily distinguished
  from fully qualified dns names, both by humans and by applications.  

  the de facto standard way to do this is to omit dots from local names.  
  if that convention is also adopted for ad hoc networks then fewer 
  applications will break.

- if you provide another way to look up DNS names (as opposed to local
  names), it needs to have results that are consistent with DNS.
  just as one example, it needs to never return "no such name" or
  "no records" when in fact it cannot tell whether the name exists
  or whether there are any such records.  this is somewhat difficult 
  to do in a disconnected network.

- a name lookup protocol that works on an ad hoc network is useful.
  but expecting a name lookup protocol to also be usable for service
  discovery creates some conflicts that are not easily resolved.

I'm about to do a new version of the requirements document.
If you have comments, now would be a good time to air them.

I support this.  At present I don't see major interest in ZMAAP,
and I think a zeroconf host profile would probably be honoured
more in the breach than the observance.

Localised multicast address allocation seems a lot easier in IPv6,
and I don't see a compelling need to do the ipv4 work right now.

Greetings List,

In his speech at Apple's developer conference last spring, Stewart 
Cheshire said that a list of Zeroconf registered Service Types 
(e.g. _printer) is available from IANA at

   http://www.iana.org/assignments/port-numbers   

I could not find any Zeroconf registered service types at this location.
Does anyone know where I can find the current list of registered 
Service Types?

First read RFC 2782. It says:

>   Numbers [STD 2] or locally.  An underscore (_) is prepended to
>   the service identifier to avoid collisions with DNS labels that

>   lookups.  The Service is case insensitive.

Then take a look at RFC 1700, which is the most recent list of port numbers
and service names (duplicated at the web address you sited).

For example, it lists the keywords ftp, ssh, printer (specifically a printer
that speaks lpr), etc. The SRV name for all of these is "_<service>._tcp" or
"_<service>._udp", as appropriate.

There are no specific "Zeroconf registered service types."

ZMAAP was how you'd do localized multicast address allocation in IPv6.
It was unclear from your response whether you support not doing 
localized multicast address allocation for IPv6 in the zeroconf WG,
but it sounds like that is what you're saying.

I think localized multicast address allocation is important 
wherever Any-Source Multicast (ASM) is important.  At present most of
the interest seems to be around Source-Specific Multicast (SSM),
and hence "no major interest" yet.

I suspect at some point ZMAAP (at least for IPv6) will need to be
done, but agree that there is not a pressing demand for it to be
done right now by the zeroconf wg.  Hence, I don't object to removing
it from the charter, but I think we'll still need it at some point 
in the future.

No abstract service such as printer is listed as a port number.
Only specific services are.  For printing, for example, you find 

printer         515/tcp    spooler
printer         515/udp    spooler

But this is none other than the LPR protocol [RFC 1179].
Other printing protocols listed in the port numbers registry are

                 35/tcp    any private printer server
                 35/udp    any private printer server
npp              92/tcp    Network Printing Protocol
npp              92/udp    Network Printing Protocol
print-srv       170/tcp    Network PostScript              
print-srv       170/udp    Network PostScript
ipp		631/tcp    IPP (Internet Printing Protocol)
ipp		631/udp    IPP (Internet Printing Protocol)
pdps		1314/tcp   Photoscript Distributed Printing System
pdps            1314/udp   Photoscript Distributed Printing System
iclpv-pm        1392/udp   Print Manager   
iclpv-pm        1392/tcp   Print Manager   
kme-trap-port   2081/tcp   KME PRINTER TRAP PORT
kme-trap-port   2081/udp   KME PRINTER TRAP PORT
ndl-aps         3096/tcp   Active Print Server Port
ndl-aps         3096/udp   Active Print Server Port
printer_agent	3396/tcp   Printer Agent
printer_agent	3396/udp   Printer Agent
jprinter	5309/tcp   J Printer
jprinter	5309/tcp   J Printer
mindprint	8033/tcp    MindPrint
mindprint	8033/udp    MindPrint
xprint-server   8100/tcp    Xprint Server
xprint-server   8100/udp    Xprint Server

Many of these entries are no longer used or represent protocols for
which it is difficult to get specifications.  Note also that ports
assigned for Netware over IP, Netbios over IP, Appletalk over IP
even Banyan over IP can be used to get printer location information
at least for printing using Novell, Microsoft, Apple, Banyan, etc
printing protocols.

There are no 'zeroconf' registered service types.

SLP is not a protocol designed or standardized by the ZEROCONF
working group.  It can be used for service discovery by clients
to find services on networks with no prior configuration.

SLP registered service type templates [RFC 2609] are at

  http://www.iana.org/assignments/svrloc-templates.htm

Registration of additional templates is simple - requiring only
a week or so of interaction with the SVRLOC template designated 
expert (me).

By convention you can also use port-number assignements in 
service URLs.  For example:  service:chargen://<host>[ ':' <port> ]
would be the location of a chargen service.

http://zeroconf.sourceforge.net has one app - "zcip"

It should be portable to any *BSD variant, but I haven't loaded
FreeBSD to actually try it yet - all the development is done on Linux.

I also don't have macos 10.2 yet - looks like I'm waiting until late
August :(

I apologise for my delay in participating in the mailing list 
discussions, but we've been very busy recently at Apple finishing up Mac 
OS X 10.2. I owe people answers to some of the good questions that have 
been raised, and I will try to do that now.

>I guess I'll rephrase my question in a different way: if I were

Apple's interest in Zeroconf is as a way to retire AppleTalk.

Many of the people working on Zeroconf and UPnP may have similar overall 
goals, but Apple believes that UPnP is overcomplicated and harder for 
device vendors to implement.

Hence, Apple has decided to adopt (i) Zeroconf link-local address 
assigment, (ii) Multicast DNS and (iii) NIAS DNS Service Discovery as its 
protocol suite to meet the ease-of-use expectations of our customers, and 
thereby allow AppleTalk to be phased out. Apple's name for this 
initiative is "Rendezvous".

If you were developing a network printer last year and wanted to sell
it to Mac customers, you needed to implement AppleTalk on that printer.

If you are developing a network printer today and want to sell it to Mac 
customers, you would be much better advised to implement Rendezvous 
instead, because it is a lot less work than AppleTalk and works a lot 
better.

Having implemented Rendezvous in your printer, Apple has software we can 
provide to you to enable to you easily discover your device and use it on 
Mac OS 9, Linux, Windows, etc. You are not dependent on waiting for 
Microsoft to support this -- the necessary parts can be easily 
implemented as user-level application code. Indeed, the AirPort Base 
Station configuration software for Windows does exactly this already to 
discover and communicate with AirPort Base Stations on the network.

None of this has any bearing on whether you decide to put UPnP into your 
device as well. View Rendezvous as an alternative to having to put a 
whole AppleTalk stack in your printer, which is a big win in itself. If, 
having done that, you decide that simply running a Rendezvous client on 
Windows meets all your needs, then perhaps you can also save yourself 
having to put the whole UPnP (and/or UPnP 2) implementation into your 
device too -- but that's a decision for each vendor to make individually.

I think the same logic that makes TTL 255 a good idea for other 
link-local applications, also applies equally well for IPv6 link local 
packets.

You could argue that a customer is less likely to have a misconfigured 
IPv6 router that inadvertently forwards inbound packets containing 
link-local addresses, but that's not a strong argument that the hoplimit 
should NOT be set to 255.

This question has been asked many times. To attempt to answer it, I wrote:

I will try to answer your questions. Please remember when reading these 
answers that Apple has millions of customers still using AppleTalk. They 
like AppleTalk. If we want to get rid of AppleTalk, we need to replace it 
with something at least as good. Hence it needs to meet the requirements 
I outlined. Arguing that you disagree with the requirements does not 
help. If AppleTalk did it and the customers value it, then Apple needs to 
meet that requirement in any replacement.

This does not satisfy:

2.1 Name-to-Address Mapping
2.7 "Name Space Management -or- Name Conflict Detection".

If you're really suggesting displaying that URL to the user, then it also 
does not satisfy:

2.5 User-Friendly Names

At the risk of repeating myself, one of Apple's requirements is 
user-friendly names. (But I don't think this requirement is unique to 
Apple.)

"ipp://169.254.23.16:631/myqueue" is not a user-friendly name.

User-friendly names SHOULD allow any characters the user desires (e.g. 
upper case, lower case, spaces, punctuation, non-roman characters, etc.)

User-friendly names SHOULD NOT require a name to contain cruft the user 
does not desire (e.g. "ipp://169.254.23.16:631" or similar). Such cruft 
may be part of the protocol on the wire, but should not be a necessary 
part of the UI.

>I would like it to be able to "scale" above a single link.

Apple's position is that Multicast DNS is intended for use on small 
networks with no infrastructure support, and it intentionally uses 
link-local multicast. If a network has two links then it needs a bridge 
or router to connect those links, so by definition you now have a box 
that is (or should be) capable of providing some level of infrastructure 
support.

Apple's position is that (in the example given above) the router that is 
connecting the two links should also include a DHCP server to assign 
addresses, and a little mini-DNS server which handles both standard DNS 
queries and Dynamic DNS Updates [RFC 3007].

>So it seems to me that either DNS-SD has to scale gracefully all

DNS-SD does scale gracefully all the way up to huge, and it does so using 
software that large organizations already have running on their networks 
-- a DNS server.

Don't make the mistake of assuming that this has to be the same hardware 
as your existing DNS server (though it can be if you want). The important 
point is that it is the same *software* as your existing DNS server -- so 
you don't have to learn, install, operate and maintain some new kind of 
server.

If you are worried about extra load on your existing DNS server, then 
just delegate the "_tcp.example.com." and "_udp.example.com." subdomains 
to a different machine. The important point is that this may be a 
different machine, but it doesn't have to be running different software.

If you want to have a specific machine that is responsible for storing 
printing service records, then you can get even more fine-grained -- 
delegate the "_printer._tcp.example.com." and "_ipp._tcp.example.com." 
subdomains to that machine.

Does "Rendezvous" come with an I* society member to
personally approve all printer configurations on your network ?
Surely, software can not operate on its own, without human
intervention, at each step of the way. If that were the case,
software might be able to "rendevous" with TLD servers and
bypass the root servers, and dynamically figure out the inclusive
namespace and track it directly from changes in the TLD servers...
...what a concept....software finding "the root"...not people...

...of course, that will never work...at least on the "toy" 32-bit
IPV4 Internet....run by the narrow-minded I* society...it is their
way or the highway...and many people seem to prefer the highway...

Are non-profit companies allowed to compete with for-profit companies under U.S. law ?
How much does Apple have to pay ICANN each year for that /8 ?

Thanks for the response.  I had come to a similar conclusion on rendezvous,
i.e. an appletalk replacement and not a full-fledged service architecture
like UPnP.

I've had the opportunity to carefully compare both architectures in the past
week.  With UPnP supporting the IETF link-local address allocation scheme
there's atleast a common ground at the lowest level. The differences clearly
start above this - with zeroconf adding a name-address translation layer
(with mDNS) and a service layer that is still being debated (SLPv2 vs
DNS-SD). I think UPnP's service architecture, based on HTTP, SOAP and XML,
holds promise although it was released prematurely before security issues
were addressed.

Subject: RE: Zeroconf and UPnP


I apologise for my delay in participating in the mailing list 
discussions, but we've been very busy recently at Apple finishing up Mac 
OS X 10.2. I owe people answers to some of the good questions that have 
been raised, and I will try to do that now.

Apple's interest in Zeroconf is as a way to retire AppleTalk.

Many of the people working on Zeroconf and UPnP may have similar overall 
goals, but Apple believes that UPnP is overcomplicated and harder for 
device vendors to implement.

Hence, Apple has decided to adopt (i) Zeroconf link-local address 
assigment, (ii) Multicast DNS and (iii) NIAS DNS Service Discovery as its 
protocol suite to meet the ease-of-use expectations of our customers, and 
thereby allow AppleTalk to be phased out. Apple's name for this 
initiative is "Rendezvous".

If you were developing a network printer last year and wanted to sell
it to Mac customers, you needed to implement AppleTalk on that printer.

If you are developing a network printer today and want to sell it to Mac 
customers, you would be much better advised to implement Rendezvous 
instead, because it is a lot less work than AppleTalk and works a lot 
better.

Having implemented Rendezvous in your printer, Apple has software we can 
provide to you to enable to you easily discover your device and use it on 
Mac OS 9, Linux, Windows, etc. You are not dependent on waiting for 
Microsoft to support this -- the necessary parts can be easily 
implemented as user-level application code. Indeed, the AirPort Base 
Station configuration software for Windows does exactly this already to 
discover and communicate with AirPort Base Stations on the network.

None of this has any bearing on whether you decide to put UPnP into your 
device as well. View Rendezvous as an alternative to having to put a 
whole AppleTalk stack in your printer, which is a big win in itself. If, 
having done that, you decide that simply running a Rendezvous client on 
Windows meets all your needs, then perhaps you can also save yourself 
having to put the whole UPnP (and/or UPnP 2) implementation into your 
device too -- but that's a decision for each vendor to make individually.

I hear these contrived examples of attribute-based queries all the time,
and I believe they are so popular because they are so cool-sounding.
The more contrived the example, the cooler it sounds.

I believe the mistake is to assume that a cool-sounding example on a 
PowerPoint slide and a useful deployable protocol are the same thing.
A useful deployable protocol is frequently dull and boring. The hard
thing is having the courage to work on something dull and boring.

In reality, who wants to have to type in some query language to find 
something? In reality, 99% of the time people want to work the way the 
old AppleTalk Chooser worked: You open the Chooser, you click on the file 
sharing icon, and a short list of choices appears. You click on "Brad 
Hards's Linux Laptop", and the remote network file system mounts so you 
can access the files.

The motivation for having a UI where the user can enter some 
attribute-based query language is based on the assumption that when you 
open our future "Chooser", there will be so many thousands of available 
file servers that no human could possibly find the one they want, so they 
will have to interface with the network through this query language to 
narrow the list of choices. This is, to me, the boil-the-ocean solution. 
(How do you make a cup of tea? 1. Put a tea bag in a cup. 2. Boil the 
ocean. 3. Pour one cup of boiling ocean water over the tea bag. This is 
(a) a lot of work, and (b) the resulting tea doesn't taste very good.)

I'm not arguing that there aren't long lists in the world, just that they 
are sufficiently varied that a one-size fits all protocol can't work for 
all of them. A network with a thousand printers is a large network, and 
large networks are managed by administrators, and once you have 
administrators, lots of options are available to you. My recommendation 
to a company with a thousand printers would be to set up a nice Web site 
with a nice user-interface. Perhaps it could have a pop up menu listing 
the company's buildings, and checkboxes for attributes like "Double 
Sided" or "Automatic Stapler", and it could display nice graphical maps 
of the company buildings showing exactly where the selected printer is 
located. A generic SLP client can't know the list of the company's 
buildings in order to present the nice popup menu. Doing this with a Web 
page means that the company can present a nice customized UI that meets 
their company needs (if they have no printers with automatic staplers, 
then they wouldn't need that checkbox) without having to develop and 
distribute client software to implement this UI on every single platform.

The proof-by-example of how this works is on-line shopping Web sites: 
There are millions of books, but Amazon didn't invent some "Book Location 
Protocol" (BLP) to let you choose the book you want. Amazon implemented a 
Web site that lets anyone with a Web browser find the book they want by 
searching for author, title, subject, publisher, etc.

I believe the world already has the necessary big-network solutions for 
the big-network problems. What we are woefully lacking is the 
small-network solution for the user at home, or the school classroom, 
where there are only one or two printers, and no one to set them up.

I'll go along with your arguments when it comes to human interaction.
However, as we enter a world with increased automation, where software-based
services are finding other services, searching by attributes (meta-data) is
needed to make unambiguous choices, even if the set only contains 2
elements.

It's the same reason why we're now defining the semantic web - the original
web was designed for human consumption.

I hear these contrived examples of attribute-based queries all the time,
and I believe they are so popular because they are so cool-sounding.
The more contrived the example, the cooler it sounds.

I believe the mistake is to assume that a cool-sounding example on a 
PowerPoint slide and a useful deployable protocol are the same thing.
A useful deployable protocol is frequently dull and boring. The hard
thing is having the courage to work on something dull and boring.

In reality, who wants to have to type in some query language to find 
something? In reality, 99% of the time people want to work the way the 
old AppleTalk Chooser worked: You open the Chooser, you click on the file 
sharing icon, and a short list of choices appears. You click on "Brad 
Hards's Linux Laptop", and the remote network file system mounts so you 
can access the files.

The motivation for having a UI where the user can enter some 
attribute-based query language is based on the assumption that when you 
open our future "Chooser", there will be so many thousands of available 
file servers that no human could possibly find the one they want, so they 
will have to interface with the network through this query language to 
narrow the list of choices. This is, to me, the boil-the-ocean solution. 
(How do you make a cup of tea? 1. Put a tea bag in a cup. 2. Boil the 
ocean. 3. Pour one cup of boiling ocean water over the tea bag. This is 
(a) a lot of work, and (b) the resulting tea doesn't taste very good.)

I'm not arguing that there aren't long lists in the world, just that they 
are sufficiently varied that a one-size fits all protocol can't work for 
all of them. A network with a thousand printers is a large network, and 
large networks are managed by administrators, and once you have 
administrators, lots of options are available to you. My recommendation 
to a company with a thousand printers would be to set up a nice Web site 
with a nice user-interface. Perhaps it could have a pop up menu listing 
the company's buildings, and checkboxes for attributes like "Double 
Sided" or "Automatic Stapler", and it could display nice graphical maps 
of the company buildings showing exactly where the selected printer is 
located. A generic SLP client can't know the list of the company's 
buildings in order to present the nice popup menu. Doing this with a Web 
page means that the company can present a nice customized UI that meets 
their company needs (if they have no printers with automatic staplers, 
then they wouldn't need that checkbox) without having to develop and 
distribute client software to implement this UI on every single platform.

The proof-by-example of how this works is on-line shopping Web sites: 
There are millions of books, but Amazon didn't invent some "Book Location 
Protocol" (BLP) to let you choose the book you want. Amazon implemented a 
Web site that lets anyone with a Web browser find the book they want by 
searching for author, title, subject, publisher, etc.

I believe the world already has the necessary big-network solutions for 
the big-network problems. What we are woefully lacking is the 
small-network solution for the user at home, or the school classroom, 
where there are only one or two printers, and no one to set them up.

Erik raises some good requirements here, and I think it is
a useful exercise to evaluate DNS-SD against this list.

> 1) security -     which services can advertise themselves?
>                   what configuration do services, clients and
>                     infrastructure need?
>                   what is the policy - what does one do with
>                     unauthenticated services one discovers?

I believe that "security through not advertising" is flawed.
A hacker can run a port scan to see what listening ports are open.
Security through not advertising makes lives harder for legitimate
users without significantly making lives harder for intruders.

The risk of discovering a rogue service on the network masquerading as a 
legitimate service is real.

The benefit of using DNS-SD is that it allows us to build on existing 
work like DNS SEC, instead of having to learn one security model for host 
names and a different one for service discovery.

A DNS server can choose to accept DNS Updates only from authorized 
clients.

A DNS resolver can choose to ignore DNS Responses that are not properly 
cryptographically signed.

> 2) organization - what administrative hierarchy is presented for browsing?

Host names can be organized into domains and subdomains
(e.g. host.sales.apple.com., host.eng.apple.com., etc.,
or host.building1.apple.com., host.building2.apple.com., etc.,
as the organization chooses).

With DNS-SD, the hierarchy of services can follow the exiting DNS 
hierarchy that the users already understand and expect.

> 3) performance -  what does the administrator have to improve performance?

It is the responsibility of the protocol designer to provide good 
performance. We should not require administrators to tinker to fix 
performance problems. Being able to tinker to fix performance problems 
may seem like a benefit at the time, but the reality is that it is an 
unreasonable burden. A manual choke in a car lets you manually adjust the 
fuel/air mix, but that is not a benefit; it is a deficiency of the car if 
it can't do that automatically for itself.

> 4) parameters -   what parameters can one obtain for services from the
>                     service discovery mechanism to configure clients
>                     (beyond merely the address of the server)?
>                   what is the 'schema' for these parameters?

Supporting a small amount of configuration is a useful feature of a 
service discovery mechanism. DNS-SD provides this feature with the 
convention of using a TXT record with the same name as the SRV record. 
For each service type, a 'profile' has to be written which specifies what 
goes in the TXT record for that service type.

As an example, the DNS-SD 'profile' that Apple is proposing for IPP and 
LPR printing includes sufficient information in the TXT record for the 
client software to automatically select the right PPD file for that 
printer without user intervention.

> 5) naming -       what are service names?

If you mean the names of service types (protocols), DNS-SD
follows the convention in RFC 2782 -- service types are defined
by the protocol names in the IANA list of well-known ports at
<http://www.iana.org/assignments/port-numbers>.

If you mean the names of service instances, they are selected freely by 
the user.

> 6) management -   what does an administrator have to do to 'set up' a
>                     group of clients and servers so that all the clients
>                     in the enterprise can discover all the same set of 
>                     services?   How can this be controlled? 

Exiting DNS concepts (e.g. the client 'search list') are a natural fit 
for this requirement.

> 7) internet       what has to happen to the protocol to make it scale
>    resource          to the internet - so services can be discovered in
>    discovery -       other administrative domains?

DNS is a distributed hierarchical system, which already supports queries 
addressed to other administrative domains. Since DNS-SD records are just 
DNS records like any other, they can be queried from other administrative 
domains like any other. To try it out, type the following:

nslookup -q=ptr _printer._tcp.stuartcheshire.org.

Indeed.  But people shouldn't have to see such things unless they want to,
or unless they specifically need to select based on IP address, port,
etc.  (sometimes they do, but it should be rare for small-scale setups).

well, maybe.  One can argue that allowing arbitrary content in a name
actually makes them less user-friendly by making it more difficult to 
type the name in correctly.  User-friendly doesn't necessarily imply
point-and-drool.

I don't know where Apple gets off thinking it can redefine the Internet
arcihtecture to make DHCP mandatory and to overload DNS to change its
semantics in a way that breaks applications.  frankly, I find it both
offensive and technically bankrupt.

There are no "Zeroconf service types".

My DNS Service Discovery draft follows the convention established in RFC
2782 -- service types are defined by the protocol names in the IANA list
of well-known ports at <http://www.iana.org/assignments/port-numbers>.

If you choose to implement DNS-SD in your product, then my recommendation 
is that you should advertise *every* listening UDP and TCP port that you 
have open.

For example:

If you have an embedded Web server, then advertise that you offer
"_http._tcp"

If you accept telnet connections, then advertise _telnet._tcp

If you accept ssh connections, then advertise _ssh._tcp

If you accept ftp connections, then advertise _ftp._tcp

If you implement snmp, then advertise _snmp._udp

... and so on.

This means that a telnet client can automatically find and display a list 
of entities on the network that are advertising that they will accept 
telnet connections (knowing what any of those entities actually are is 
not important to the author of the telnet client -- if you can connect to 
it with telnet, then the telnet client can talk to it).

An ssh client can automatically find and display a list of entities on 
the network that are advertising that they will accept ssh connections, 
and so on.

If you make some future "foobar" product, with which the user can 
communicate over an ssh connection, then my ssh client software doesn't 
need to know what a "foobar" is, it just needs to know that it can talk 
ssh to it. I (as a human being) may know what a "foobar" is, but my ssh 
client doesn't need to know.

There is precedent for this. Every time a new PostScript network printer 
comes out, users don't need a new driver for it (at least this is true on 
the Mac). As long as the printer speaks PostScript over AppleTalk 
properly, the Apple LaserWriter driver can find it and print on it, even 
though this particular printer model may not have even existed when the 
Apple LaserWriter driver was written.

Don't be ridiculous Keith.

There's no need to waste the IESG's time with nonsense like this, and
I'm only cc'ing the IESG on this reply to correct this misinformation.

Apple is not making anything mandatory.

I simply stated Apple's position, which is that for problems that are 
solved perfectly well today using DHCPv4 and DNS, we do not support or 
endorse any attempt to define new protocols to duplicate this 
functionality.

We believe that there are cases where no good protocols currently exist, 
and cases where good protocols exist (even though there may not be 
shipping products today that implement those protocols). It is important 
to make a distinction between those two cases. Where the problem is lack 
of a good protocol, designing a good protocol may be warranted. Where we 
believe there is already a perfectly good protocol, but the problem is 
lack of implementations of that protocol, then designing a new protocol 
is not warranted.

We believe that DNS, DNS SEC, DNS UPDATE, etc., are good protocols (or at 
least potentially good protocols). The fact that I know of no consumer 
gateway/firewall/NAT product that currently implements a DNS server with 
DNS UPDATE is not a reason to go and invent new protocols for this 
specific situation. The vendors of these products already have protocols 
available for them to use, should they wish to market a product that 
implements them. If they don't wish to market a product with these 
capabilities, then inventing new protocols is unlikely to change their 
minds on that subject.

Huh? Companies have been shipping such gateways for years now, and they
work fine. Nothing about mini-DNS servers breaks applications, assuming
that it is implemented correctly. Remember, the mini-DHCP/DNS approach is
an *alternative* to mDNS, which if available, should cause mDNS not to be
used, at least as described in draft-ietf-dnsext-mdns-11.txt. So it's
quite harmless.

About the only new wrinkle in Stuart's post is the support for Dynamic DNS
updates, which while a good idea, is not yet supported in most home
gateways. However, it is not hard to add, and is particularly useful for
IPv6, where DHCPv6 lite may not be available on the gateway. Supporting
Dynamic DNS update would therefore permit dynamic name resolution in
situations where this would not otherwise be possible.

I am surprised that Apple of all people might suggest that because a query
appears on the wire in an arcane form, that the user should see this.

Of course the chooser software has to filter
"service:printer:http://169.254.17.202;(name=Epson Stylus 900n)" to present
the user with something more friendly - like showing "Epson Stylus 900n" in
its printer selection (assuming that the user hasn't even changed the
manufacturers default name to something more useful).

This idea might be true now but it is very rapidly becoming false - IP devices
of the "internet toaster" variety are rapidly getting smaller and much more
widespread. I work in a field (entertainment technology) where networks with
several thousand devices came over the horizon a while ago and are now
knocking on the door. These networks are actually small in their scope and
certainly don't have expert system administrators behind them - there are even
companies wanting to manage them from Apple computers.

The persistence of the idea that a network with a lot of small devices will be
a large network with plenty of resources or is necessarily complex, is a
barrier to progress.

This is _not_a big network problem. The school doesn't have a network in the
classroom. It has a network in the whole school. This network will soon have
not only lots of printers and file shares but also coffee machines, learning
resources of all sorts, cooking equipment, environmental controls, lighting
controls, musical instruments and so on - and still no one to set them up. The
hard pressed teachers want to teach kids - not become sys-admins.

SLP presents a glimmer of hope in this jungle. I cannot see that DNS-SD does.

SLP allows a user friendly name attribute, even a (binary) colorful icon
attribute. This is what would appear in human interfaces.   The URI is
only used by applications.

It is a contrived example, but it certainly isn't intended to be cool.

I want to understand the logic - I've never been to a IETF meeting,
and am unlikely to. But I still want to make use of this technology,
and I need to really understand it to make the most use of this,
and to help others use it too.

So the questions are phrased in terms of a user goal. I know that
the implementation is going to be hard (and possibly boring). But
I am going to completely stuff the implementation if I don't 
understand the fundamentals.

<snip>
This answers the question (I think). The way to do a search by name is:
* we map all the available drives.
* we search the drives using standard tools (eg, find -name '*zcip*' -print)

I have no problem with this approach (or any approach). I just want to
understand it.

Sure it does.  Search for the printer which has the name attribute
equal to the name of the printer you are seeking.   Get its address.

> 2.7 "Name Space Management -or- Name Conflict Detection".

Sure it does.  Search for the printer which has the name X.  If a
printer replies, do not use the name X.  If you want to find out
*immediately* if a printer is advertising itself with the name X, use
RFC 3082, Notification and Subscription for SLP.

No, you can display a user friendly name attribute or even a binary

So in the file search example I raised earlier, you might do DNS queries for
_cifs._tcp
_rsync._tcp
_ftp._tcp
_http._tcp
_nfs._tcp 

Then you can map whatever services are offered, and search through the 
various drives for a certain name (or size, whatever the user wants).

Is this the intended approach?

the conclusion does not follow, because some nodes in an applicaiton may
be using addresses obtained from mDNS at the same time others are using 
addresses obtained from DNS - if the two views are inconsistent (and they
will be) this can break the application.  also it appears that mDNS 
introduces new error conditions that applications written to expect
DNS semantics will misinterpret, and also uses existing error codes
to report conditions that differ from those used in DNS (e.g. NXRRSET
to report the case where no host responds even though there may actually
be such an RRSET in DNS).

mDNS WILL break applications if it is used to implement DNS APIs.

The two views don't need to be inconsistent. You haven't provided any
_evidence_ that this will occur.

So your statement is reduced to an unsubstantiated assertion.

Either people want to make this work, or they just want to kill
the whole thing. If you don't like what is being proposed, then
either propose something else, or don't use the implementations.
If the 80% solution breaks a few buggy applications, then it
was probably well beyond time to upgrade them anyway.

the only way to have _evidence_ is to deploy the thing, which we rarely
have at the time a protocol is up for proposed standard.  I've made an
_argument_, based on some analysis, that this problem will occur.
 
> So your statement is reduced to an unsubstantiated assertion.

the assertion is substantiated by analysis.   the analysis could
be incorrect of course, but I don't think so.
 
> Either people want to make this work, or they just want to kill

false.  having a local name lookup service is clearly useful, I don't
know anybody who wants to kill that.  the problem is that people are 
trying to "make this work" by overloading an existing DNS query
interface and/or by having that interface respond (inconsistently
from DNS) for existing DNS names.

so what you are saying that it's okay for the zeroconf WG to approve
something that breaks existing applicaitons, and if it does so then 
it's the applications' fault.  what a crock!  that's like saying
that if the bridge collapses then it was the cars' fault for driving
over it...

and though I often try to do so --- no, I don't need to propose something 
else.  the burden is on those who propose new standards-track protocols 
to produce protocols that don't have known technical limitations with 
respect to the requirements placed on them.   if they can't do that,
the proposals deserve to either die or be labelled as informational or
experimental until such time as the problems have been solved.

it's been obvious since the first zeroconf BOF that this WG would have a
difficult time developing protocols that met its goals without breaking
things - what it seems like now is that the WG has mostly ignored that 
set of problems.

that would certainly be a concern also.  in general any inconsistent view caused
by the introduction of mDNS - whether it be leakage of bogus mDNS records into 
DNS or leakage of bogus mDNS records into applicaitons that had some nodes
using DNS  - should be cause for concern.

People keep assuming that it's okay to have different views of DNS according
to location in the network topology. I don't share that assumption.  Applications
don't recognize network topology boundaries.

        have you ever tested any of mDNS-ish solutions in real life?  it
        doesn't break anything.  it just works, and works great.
        if you want to give it a shot, try kame mdnsd (uses old mDNS draft)
        or revlookupd (draft-itojun-ipv6-nodeinfo-revlookup-00.txt).

have you ever tested any of these solutions with distributed applications,
where some of the nodes are using mDNS and others aren't?

Not sure why this causes mini-DNS servers to break applications. Can you
explain? mDNS will never be used where a mini-DNS server is present so
there are no "error conditions" or "inconsistencies".

One could imagine a scenario where a node attempts to do a DNS Dynamic
update for a linklocal address, for example. I suspect that few DNS
servers will automatically drop such an update today.

This is one of the reasons why the mDNS and DNS caches are separate and
also why DNS servers are prohibited from answering mDNS queries for RRs
for which they are not authoritative.

I think that Keith is referring to situations in which the DNS
configuration mechanism goes down sporadically. For example, where there
is high packet loss or broken connections or where the DNS discovery
mechanism is sporadic. In that case, some nodes may be configured with a
DNS server and others may not be.

I think that this argument doesn't relate to mDNS so much as to the
importance of resilience in service discovery/configuration.

the problem is in the notion of "where a mini-DNS server is present" -
it can be present for some nodes in an application and absent for others.

yes, it does help if the names are in separate spaces, though if the names
have dots in them it can still confuse applications that expect names
with dots in them to be global.

I'd define a distributed app as any app which communicates over a network and
has more than two nodes.

Keith

p.s. re: your comment about running code.  running code does help demonstrate
that the spec is implementable, and if there are multiple implementations
of the code that interoperate, it helps demonstrate that the spec is clearly 
written.  it usually doesn't help demonstrate that the protocol scales - 
and the sort of problem I'm concerned about can be viewed as a scaling problem.
i.e. what works well in limited trials does not necessarily work well in
large-scale deployment.  so even if we have running code we still cannot abandon
analysis as a predictor of potential failure.

that's one way it can happen.  there are others.

in general one should not assume that every node in an application is 
configured consistently with every other node.    nor is it reasonable
to assume that nodes using mDNS are on an isolated newtork.  connection
to and configuration of DNS, and connections to other networks  can
exist independently of one another.

there's also a problem with the answers to DNS queries (as seen  by 
a node of an application) changing over time depending on whether
mDNS or DNS is being used at that particular time.

There is a lot of temptation to add all these nice features to make searches
more precise, because engineers love precise, and precision is a good thing.
There's just one problem: Humans who aren't engineers aren't terribly
precise.

They want a list of printers. From the list of printers, they pick the
printer they want, set it as a default, (hopefully, this is done
automatically), and if they never ever have to change that, then they're
fine. If they are presented with a really long list of printers in this
area, they have one thought, (What idiot set up this list), and one action,
(Hello help desk? This is bob in accounting. Which printer out of this list
of 300 should I print to?) Ask anyone who's done user support, you hit the
average user with a print selection that has too many options, they're NOT
going to like it at all. They just want to find a printer, not perform a
search. (Yes, I realize the paradox in that last sentence)

I spent a few years doing IVR programming, and realized that if you hit
someone with a really long list, they'll punt and ask for help, and you need
to rethink your design anyway. Using DNS should allow you to create properly
populated subdomains that present a sane amount of choices to the user. If
you give them proper names, "Color HP Laser with stapler", then people will
pick the one they need. But they browse for printers, servers, etc. Not
"color lasers with 8 output trays, secure printing and a stapler."

I also see one real flaw with the "We must put in lots of fields so that you
can be more precise" approach.

 People don't, by and large, change a setting that works. Once people have
the printers they need set up in Print Center, they aren't going to ever
browse for another one unless they have to.

I've seen users ignore the Chooser for months, even years, as long as the
stuff they needed was available without it. If they can automount a server
once they've selected it, why go looking for more?

The first one is done by people who run servers, and as to the
second...well, lets just say that if you spring that on the average user, or
group of users, you don't want to have any pitchforks or torches about.

I may be harping on the user side of things, but that's who is going to be
stuck with this. That's why people still love the way the Chooser works.
Geeks and engineers will use three hundred alternate ways to do something.
Ma and Pa Kettle want something that *is* point and drool...and if they
could make it require even less thought, they'd want that even more.

No, but humans like arbitrary content. As well, if you work with people that
don't read english that well, being able to set up printer queues in their
native language isn't a convenience, it's a necessity. Simple is good, but
quite hard to do right. But that's what users want. Along with the ability
to assign some rather silly names to things...like B0bz pr1nt3r

That's all well and good, but I have yet to see anyone implementing SLP in a
usable fashion for things like printing. It's certainly not being
implemented at home, or in the small business. I've thought about using SLP
as a replacement for AppleTalk zones, but, have found that while the idea
may certainly be full-featured and elegant, the implementation, to put it
bluntly, blows.

I have a rather nice Xerox Phaser 1235DX, supports almost ever protocol you
would want to print with. But to use SLP with it, you have to do that at the
server, because the printer doesn't support it. So I have to set up SLP just
to allow non-Appletalk print browsing. That's a pain, even in a small
situation. Now, multiply that across a really large domain.

uh, we're talking about technologies for discovering resources on ad hoc
networks.   set-once-and-forget isn't going to work in this case, because the 
next time the user prints it will be on a *different* network.

John,
	You're again bringing this back to the human aspect of "choosing"
things.  For software agents to search and select services attribute-based
searching is a necessity.

There is a lot of temptation to add all these nice features to make searches
more precise, because engineers love precise, and precision is a good thing.
There's just one problem: Humans who aren't engineers aren't terribly
precise.

They want a list of printers. From the list of printers, they pick the
printer they want, set it as a default, (hopefully, this is done
automatically), and if they never ever have to change that, then they're
fine. If they are presented with a really long list of printers in this
area, they have one thought, (What idiot set up this list), and one action,
(Hello help desk? This is bob in accounting. Which printer out of this list
of 300 should I print to?) Ask anyone who's done user support, you hit the
average user with a print selection that has too many options, they're NOT
going to like it at all. They just want to find a printer, not perform a
search. (Yes, I realize the paradox in that last sentence)

I spent a few years doing IVR programming, and realized that if you hit
someone with a really long list, they'll punt and ask for help, and you need
to rethink your design anyway. Using DNS should allow you to create properly
populated subdomains that present a sane amount of choices to the user. If
you give them proper names, "Color HP Laser with stapler", then people will
pick the one they need. But they browse for printers, servers, etc. Not
"color lasers with 8 output trays, secure printing and a stapler."

I also see one real flaw with the "We must put in lots of fields so that you
can be more precise" approach.

 People don't, by and large, change a setting that works. Once people have
the printers they need set up in Print Center, they aren't going to ever
browse for another one unless they have to.

I've seen users ignore the Chooser for months, even years, as long as the
stuff they needed was available without it. If they can automount a server
once they've selected it, why go looking for more?

Actually, no it won't in an office situation for desktop machines. The
printer stays on 24x7, but goes into a power save mode. The desktops stay on
24x7, albeit with the screens turned off. (IT people like this for silly
things like backups and updates.)

So for all non-portables, this information isn't going to change much at
all. If you are using a print server, or some other fairly static device,
you can then have it maintain the records for the printers so that when
mobile devices connect, they still show the same printers at the same
addresses.

Finally, you (from what I can tell), can set up conventional DNS servers to
maintain this information outside of the .local zone so that users
connecting from remote locations can keep that information consistent as
well.

I think the issue here is not if attribute-based searching is a 
necessity or not. Of course it is, since to look someting up you need 
to do it based on an attribute of that particular thing. In the case 
of DNS-SD, these attributes are type and name. This is simple, and it 
works. Take the yellow pages as a real world analogy. You look up a 
'type' of 'service', and then you look up the name (if you have one 
in mind) or choose from the available options.

Sure, it would probably be very useful to some to have a nice complex 
meta-data managing and querying engine where I could look up 
auto-shops with mechanics specializing in air intake efficienty 
techniques, yet after all these years we still have the basic and 
simple solution of looking up a service by type and name.

Why? Because it works, it's elegant, and it's simple.

I think this was John's point. And I think this is the point (and big 
advantage) of DNS-SD.

Because in the end, it's the only aspect that counts. (Computers don't buy
computers, humans do) As well, humans are far better at figuring out what
they want then software agents are, especially for things like printers.

We aren't talking about complex things like stock analysis agents here.
We're talking about simple things:

Things that create dead trees (printers)
Things that store bits (file servers)
Things that let me connect to things to do non-bit-storing things (ssh)
Things that show me movies (video servers)

In the case of printers...all it has to do is show a list of printers. If
the DNS is set up right, there is no reason to show me every printer in the
company. AppleTalk didn't do that unless you set it up wrong. Set up
correctly, all that should pop up is a list of local printers. SLP will do
this, but it's complex to set up, and an additional protocol that we have to
route, and filter, and look for hacks on. We already use DNS, it already has
the basic ability to do this, let's keep this simple.

I agree - in an office situation for desktop machines, you don't need 
the autodiscovery mechanism nearly as much, because set-and-forget mostly
works there.  but that's not where I expect zeroconf technologies to be used.

the interesting situation is for the portables that want to use
set-and-forget while at home (or work) but not have that selection 
affect their defaults when they're in an environment where they
don't have a nearby default printer.

Service discovery is not limited to servers or printers. KDE 3.1 will have a 
feature called "Desktop Sharing" that is quite similar to Apple's Remote 
Desktop or WinXP's Remote Assistance. It allows an administrator to connect 
to a user's computer, watch the users desktop and, possibly, control his 
mouse and enter keystrokes. Each desktop sharing service announces its 
availability using SLP, together with the user's full name and user id. 
This allows an administrator to search for the user by name or id. Sometimes 
the administrator may only know the first or last name, so he can query for 
all Johns or all Millers. Or when the admin does not know how to spell the 
name he can enter a part of the name.

Actually, I can see it as being a great place for offices...trust me, if I
never have to set up another DHCP server again, I'll not be complaining. In
my experience, DHCP is such a pain, that I don't even bother with it.
Zeroconf allows me to dump DHCP, and makes things easier for me, and simpler
for my users. What more could I want?

Then you take advantage of multihoming, and have both environments running
over the same interface.

But that isn't unique to SLP, and in a secure environment, you're seriously
considering disabling every non-essential protocol anyway. DNS is essential,
SLP is not.

zeroconf doesn't allow you to dump DHCP unless you're willing to statically 
configure all of your hosts that need to talk outside your local LAN, 
in order to give them global addresses.

so in answer to 'what more could I want?' - perhaps you'd like your
applications to work over the network?  (or if you don't, your users might...)

in the yellow pages you can (and occasionally do) have multiple 
resources with the same name.    this is fundamentally incompatible
with a DNS interface.

Um...I use NAT, so they don't need global addresses, nor do I want them to
have global addresses. They sit behind a NAT server/firewall, which handles
all that for me. As far as the Internet is concerned, all my machines have
the same IP address anyway, so internal addressing is immaterial.

Um...they do, because NAT deals with that part of it.

Okay, so you can't directly map the phone book to a DNS server. But then,
you aren't going to have multiple devices with the exact same hostname in an
single AppleTalk zone, or a single SLP zone either. For one, the humans
don't like it.

But, since DNS allows for hierarchy, you *could* have different zones with
resources with the same name, and not conflict, in the same way you can have
different AppleTalk zones with identically named devices. Foo.mit.edu is not
the same as foo.sloan.mit.edu, even though the hostname of each device is
still foo. One is foo over there, and the other is foo over here.

It's still a valid analogy for how the humans search.

I think you missed the point of my analogy. My argument was not that 
DNS-SD is completely identical and compatible with the yellow pages. 
I know DNS is not yellow. I know DNS is not stackable in my 
bookshelf. :)

The point I was trying to make refers to the philosophy and approach 
of searching and finding services only.

collisions will happen.  perhaps those conflicts will get resolved 
over time, but trying to look up such names via a protocol that doesn't
recognize that collisions are likely doesn't seem like a good idea.

in a properly designed system humans can use other clues to 
disambiguate multiple services with the same name - e.g. for printers
they could look at device type, characteristics, location, etc.
OTOH expecting humans to know which name goes with which printer,
in an ad hoc network, is a bit much.

DNS has no built-in assumption that the leftmost component of a domain 
name is meaningful in its own right.

well we were talking about this analogy in the specific context of 
using DNS for service discovery.  yes, humans can do fuzzy searches,
but DNS wasn't designed to facilitate this.

Um, from what I've read on stuart's ideas about mDNS, it seems to have the
collision issue handled nicely.

Real world experience since 1986 or so shows that it is not only *not* a bit
much, but that people prefer it. Why? When you want to find a restaurant,
you first go to Restaurants in the phone book, *then* you look for
restaurants, Chinese, etc. you do not, in normal life, start your search
looking for a Chinese restaurant that as Szechwan death as the Tuesday
dinner special, oh, and by the way, it needs to be on the corner of fifth
and main. You get the basic information for the restaurant, and the call it
to find out details.

This is *exactly* how service browsing should work. You select a main
category, "printers", then, if there are enough, you pick the zone. You then
get a list of printers in that zone. If they are named correctly, you have a
better idea of what the capabilities are, or you call for information. If
you only have one printer on your floor, then you don't care.

Overloading the humans with information in the initial search is a
guarannteed way to fail. You think the chooser has lasted so long because
it's the technical best way to do things? It really isn't, BUT, it works the
way that humans want things to work. NBP is not the best way to do things,
but the success of the implementation can't be denied.

No, but the servers do, and if the entire name resolution maps them to
different IP addresses, then it's all good. Even if it maps them to
different services on the same host, with the same IP address, it's all
good. If you couldn't do this, then setting up multiple print queues via LPR
would really suck.

Right. SO don't make the search protocol smarter than it needs to be. All it
needs to do is present a list of printers in the user's zone. That's all.
Anything else is over-engineering the protocol.

Here is my understanding of the origin (and solution) to this problem.

Let's go through what happens in a home gateway failure scenario. Since
the home gateway has addressing & configuration (e.g. DHCPv4, IPV6 RA,
DHCPv6-lite, etc.) as well as DNS server functionality, if it goes down,
then nodes coming up will have neither a configured address nor a DNS
server address.

For LL IPv4, this means that they will auto-allocate an address from
169.254/16, and will also use mDNS for name resolution.

Hosts that booted when the home gateway was up will also have an IPv4 LL
address (at least under draft-ietf-zeroconf-ipv4-linklocal-05.txt), but
they also may have a configured address. So they can still communicate
with the zeroconf-only hosts. Eventually when the home gateway comes
back the zeroconf-only nodes will find it and will also have a
configured address. So the problem will right itself, though the timescale
on which this occurs might be an issue (I've not found 5 minutes to be a
satisfactory time between attempts to find a home gateway, in my
experience).

Similarly, hosts that booted when the gateway was up will be configured
with a DNS server (the gateway) which will not be functioning, while the
hosts that booted when the gateway was down will not have a DNS server
configured. As a result, the configured hosts will send their queries to
the (down) DNS proxy, while the zeroconf hosts will send mDNS queries
immediately.

This situation will be remedied iff the process by which a zeroconf
requests a configured non-LL address periodically also results in the host
being configured with a DNS server. This is true, for example, for DHCPv4,
since this provides both addressing and configuration. Thus, if the
gateway comes back, then all the hosts on the network will be in the same
state with respect to mDNS usage eventually.

However, for IPv6, the repair process is more complex. While RA might
provide a non-LL address, if the DNS configuration mechanism is not also
periodically retried (presumably with the same timers as address
configuration), then the zeroconf and configured hosts may retain
different configurations indefinitely. I think that this is an issue.

The effects of this are far from catastrophic though. Assuming that the
configured hosts query mDNS only for non-qualified names (e.g. "foo") as
advocated in mDNS-11, then they will be able to resolve the non-qualified names of
zeroconf hosts.

On the other hand, the zeroconf hosts will query for FQDNs, but will not
receive an answer in most cases, since hosts only answer mDNS queries
for names for which they are authoritative. Having the host query via
mDNS because the gateway is initially down does create a
security vulnerability, because an attacker could answer the mDNS
queries of zeroconf hosts, poisoning the mDNS cache, whereas configured
hosts would not send such queries. To take advantage of this, the attacker
could overwhelm the DNS configuration server.

The solution is to require that the DNS configuration mechanism be
periodically retried if it initially fails. Of course this also implies
that it be able to "fail" -- which is not possible for some IPv6 DNS
configuration mechanisms.

> Here is my understanding of the origin (and solution) to this problem.

first off, this is just one scenario in which the problem can occur.  
and your proposed solution only works for that scenario (perhaps a
few others) but not for the problem in general.

here's some big problems with this scenario: you're assuming that
all of the hosts of concern are on the same link and they're all
affected in the same way.  you're assuming that the component that
exhibits the failure and the DNS server(s) used by the nodes
share fate.  I'm not saying that this situation cannot exist or 
even that it cannot be common; I'm saying that a solution that
happens to work in this situation cannot be considered general.

it's also not reasonable to assume that other hosts even on the same link
have a linklocal address - first because they may predate the introduction
of linklocal address space; second because they may have (quite reasonably) 
disabled LL addresses since it will cause problems for some applications .
actually insisting that every host support linklocal is one of the 
unacceptable (to me) provisions of the current draft that I hope IESG has 
the good sense to block.  (and no, this scenario doesn't justify forcing 
each host and app to deal with linklocal addresses)

false.  but even that is not the real problem.

the real problem is that you can have some hosts using DNS servers
(not all the same DNS server) and other hosts using mDNS, talking
to each other at the same time.  and some of these hosts can have
connectivity to the outside world while others do not.

because in the real world networks do not fit into neat litle patterns.

it cannot possibly handle the collision issue properly if using the same

sure, but you still use claimed attributes of those restaurants in making

that only works if the attributes you are interested in are exposed in the
name, and if the hierarchy is arranged in the order that *you* need in
order to select a printer, etc.

no, that's not sufficient.  and while you might argue that the user's computer
can poll every computer in the "user's zone" to see what its capabilities are
so that it can actually make an intelligent selection when there are more
than a few printers in the "user's zone" - it doesn't scale very well to zones
of the size contemplated by zeroconf - much less for use on non-ad hoc networks.

Um...host name conflicts happen all the time if you aren't careful. Wonks

No, you use the simplest qualifications to start, then to more complex. You
refine the search. You don't start out with the desired seating chart and
cooking times of the food.

No, it works when they are not exposed in the name as well. And I didn't
invent NBP or the Chooser, but I haven't seen anything else that user grock
as well. People want simple, but that doesn't mean they are stupid. Again,
in a network situation, printers are static devices. They don't move. Once
you pick one, you can rely on it being there. Even if it changes IP
addresses, it *doesn't matter* because you are using the name, not the
address. So the printer has to be turned off long enough for something else
to claim that name in that zone. It just doesn't happen enough to rig a
complex search mechanism to avoid something that just isn't a problem.

The humans have to like it and use it, or it's a failure. I doubt mDNS and
DNS-SD is overloading DNS anytime soon...it's quite robust.

Um, it scales really well actually. You don't poll for individual
capabilities. Sheesh, if you want that, then why bother with browsing, let's
all just use LPR, it's about as usable as SLP is at the moment, and name
every printer 
"HP_Laser_5SI_MX_mopier_600DPI_envelope_feeder_1500_sheet_hi_cap_tray_256MB_
RAM_9GB_hard_disk_duplexing_with_stapler_and_five_bin_output_tray"

*NO ONE* is going to look at that garbage twice...I know this because once
upon a time, I had the bright idea to put technically precise names on
printers as much as possible. I had to disconnect my phone so I could get on
with the work of renaming them imprecise things like "4th Floor Marketing
Printer"

Simple browsing is what the humans want.

DNS and hosts idea of their names can be out of sync, and DNS servers can be 
out of sync with one another if they are misconfigured, and these are
indeed problems sometimes.  but DNS cannot supply conflicting information if 
it is properly configured.  on the other hand, it's perfectly reasonable to
have two servers on the same LAN with the same properties down to the serial
number.

what is simplest to you may not be simplest to someone else.  one person
wants to find Chinese food, and another wants to find quick food nearby.
a single hierarchy will not satisfy both.

NO IT DOES NOT.  If I need a color printer the name of the printer isn't 
going to help me find one unless "color" is somehow exposed in its name.
Similarly if I need a duplexing printer.  And these are very common requirements.

NOT IN AN AD HOC NETWORK they are not.

you mean, like when there's a power failure for several hours, like there

They are trying to shove a lookup operation with differnet semantics
and failure conditions than DNS into the DNS API.  That's overloading.

to networks with 1000 hosts?

well, either you get a list of printers and poll for capabilities, or you expose
the capabilities in the names of the printers, or you use a service discovery 
protocol.  which is it?

I agree with that but I never said that they would.  I'm just saying that
the DNS query API is a poor interface for discovering services on an ad hoc 
network.
